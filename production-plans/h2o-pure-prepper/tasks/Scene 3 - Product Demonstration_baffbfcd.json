  "prompt": "Show weathered hands with visible calluses and pores carefully holding the H2O Pure bottle, demonstrating the compact size by rotating it slowly in natural workshop lighting with 2:1 exposure ratio. The hands show work-worn texture with dirt traces under the fingernails and slightly rough skin, emphasizing the practical nature of the user. Gentle movement as fingers trace the product label, highlighting the key information: treats 15 gallons, 8 drops per gallon, made in USA. Shot on 50mm lens at F5.6 aperture with macro-style framing, slight handheld movement for authentic feel. Atmospheric dust particles float in the workshop air with subtle shadows and natural imperfections on the workbench surface. The scene maintains 60% neutral workshop tones, 30% skin tone and clothing colors, and 10% product blue accents for clear visibility. Ambient workshop sounds with subtle bottle handling audio (no subtitles). Avoid perfect hands, studio lighting, or artificial presentation.",
