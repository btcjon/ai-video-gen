  "prompt": "The weathered man with calloused hands and visible pores now confidently places the small H2O Pure bottle into his organized emergency kit in the same garage workshop, fluorescent lighting maintaining the 2:1 exposure ratio. His expression shows quiet satisfaction and preparedness as he adjusts other supplies around it - first aid kit, water containers, and practical gear on metal shelving. The worn flannel shirt and work-hardened hands demonstrate his authentic lifestyle, with natural skin texture and individual facial hairs visible in the practical lighting. Shot on 50mm lens at F4.5 aperture from eye-level angle with subtle pan movement following his methodical organization. The scene features the same 60% industrial gray and beige garage tones, 30% functional equipment colors, and 10% safety blue accents from the product now integrated into his preparedness system. Ambient garage atmosphere with subtle sounds of organization and distant ventilation (no subtitles). Avoid commercialized presentation, perfect conditions, or unrealistic staging.",
