  "prompt": "The same weathered man with calloused hands and visible pores now stands in his well-organized garage workshop, fluorescent lighting creating a 2:1 exposure ratio against the concrete walls. He wears the same faded flannel with rolled sleeves, now examining his water storage setup with mason jars, camping gear, and emergency supplies visible on metal shelving. His work-worn fingers with dirt under the nails reach toward a small blue H2O Pure bottle on the workbench, surrounded by practical prepping supplies. Shot on 50mm lens at F4.5 aperture from slightly low angle with static camera positioning, emphasizing his methodical approach to preparedness. The scene features 60% industrial gray and beige tones from the garage environment, 30% functional silver and black from tools and equipment, and 10% blue safety accents from the product. Ambient garage sounds of distant ventilation and subtle equipment hums fill the practical workspace (no subtitles). Avoid perfect organization, pristine conditions, or commercial staging.",
