  "prompt": "A weathered middle-aged man with calloused hands and visible pores kneels beside a murky creek in golden hour light, wearing a faded flannel shirt with rolled sleeves and slight sweat stains. His graying beard shows individual hairs catching the warm 2:1 exposure ratio sunlight filtering through trees, creating soft volumetric rays in the humid air with floating dust particles. He cups the questionable water in his work-worn hands, examining it with a concerned expression as his brow furrows with natural skin texture and worry lines. Shot on 50mm lens at F4 aperture from eye-level angle with slight handheld movement, capturing the authentic moment of a practical man facing water uncertainty. The scene features 60% warm earth tones from the forest setting, 30% muted greens from foliage, and 10% golden accent light on his weathered skin. Ambient forest sounds of flowing water and distant birds fill the natural environment (no subtitles). Avoid perfect lighting, artificial poses, unrealistic skin, or staged scenarios.",
