      "prompt": "A weathered father in his early 40s sits at a worn wooden kitchen table during golden hour, stress lines etched around his tired brown eyes, visible pores across his forehead glistening with a thin layer of perspiration, a few gray strands breaking free from his otherwise neat dark hair as he stares down at scattered emergency supply lists and water storage calculations written on crumpled notebook paper. The background reveals a modest suburban kitchen with outdated appliances, dust particles floating lazily through warm volumetric sunlight streaming through a west-facing window, casting long shadows across vintage linoleum flooring. His calloused hands with pronounced knuckle creases slowly flip through pages while his shoulders carry the weight of family responsibility, wearing a faded navy blue work shirt with subtle wrinkles around the collar and sleeves. Shot with 50mm lens at F2.8 aperture using a slow dolly-in movement from a slightly elevated angle, creating intimate vulnerability. Lighting maintains a 2:1 exposure ratio with natural key light from the window and soft ambient fill, enhanced by floating dust motes and gentle atmospheric haze. The color palette features 60% warm earth tones from wood and paper, 30% cool blue shadows, and 10% golden accent light. Ambient kitchen sounds include distant suburban traffic, a ticking wall clock, and the soft rustle of turning pages (no subtitles).",
