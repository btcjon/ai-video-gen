## Batch Processing Plan

### Generation Sequence
1. **Phase 1:** Scenes 1-2 (text-to-video foundation)
2. **Phase 2:** Scenes 3-7 (image-to-video with product)
3. **Quality Review:** Each scene before continuation
4. **Frame Extraction:** Last frame from each completed scene

### API Configuration
```bash
# Text-to-video scenes (1-2)
python3 scripts/veo3_generate.py generate \
  --prompt "[scene-specific-prompt]" \
  --model "veo3" \
  --quality-score 8.5

# Image-to-video scenes (3-7)
python3 scripts/veo3_generate.py generate \
  --prompt "[action-focused-prompt]" \
  --image /images/6mL\ H2O\ Pure_square.png \
  --model "veo3" \
  --quality-score 8.5

# Continuation scenes
python3 scripts/veo3_generate.py generate \
  --prompt "[85%-similar-prompt]" \
  --continue-from [previous-task-id] \
  --quality-score 8.5
```

### Cost Analysis
- **7 scenes × $1.50 (veo3 model) = $10.50 total**
- **Estimated generation time: 70-105 minutes**
