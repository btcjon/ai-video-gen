# Technical Production Specifications: H2O Pure Prepper Campaign

## Creative Context

**Production Philosophy**: Documentary authenticity over commercial polish

---

## Camera Plan: Documentary Realism

### Primary Lens Strategy
**50mm Lens (Primary - 70% of shots)**
- **Rationale**: Natural human perspective, no distortion, honest representation
- **Psychology**: "What you see is what you get" - matches prepper skepticism of hype
- **Usage**: Character dialogue, product demonstration, family moments

**35mm Lens (Establishing - 20% of shots)**
- **Rationale**: Shows environment context without wide-angle distortion
- **Usage**: Home prep areas, storage spaces, outdoor scenarios
- **Avoids**: Dramatic wide shots that feel "Hollywood"

**85mm Lens (Details - 10% of shots)**
- **Rationale**: Isolates important details, slight compression feels trustworthy
- **Usage**: Product close-ups, label reading, hands working

### Aperture Settings: Practical Depth
**F4-F5.6 (Primary Range)**
- **Rationale**: Balanced sharpness, realistic depth of field
- **Psychology**: Everything important is in focus - no artistic blur hiding details
- **Technical**: Avoids shallow DOF that screams "commercial production"

**F2.8 (Selective Use)**
- **Only for**: Emotional family moments, evening/indoor low light
- **Limits**: Minimal background blur, keep practical elements visible

**F8 (Documentation Shots)**
- **Usage**: Product labels, instruction reading, technical demonstrations
- **Rationale**: Sharp detail builds trust - preppers read everything

### Movement Design: Steady & Purposeful
**Static Shots (60%)**
- **Rationale**: Stable, observational, documentary-style
- **Psychology**: Calm confidence, no rushed camera work
- **Usage**: Character talking, product demonstration, reading labels

**Slow Dolly (25%)**
- **Speed**: Very gradual, revealing information logically
- **Direction**: Forward push for emphasis, lateral for exploration
- **Avoids**: Fast movements that feel "promotional"

**Handheld (15%)**
- **Style**: Minimal shake, controlled handheld
- **Usage**: Following someone to prep area, over-shoulder perspectives
- **Technique**: Simulate someone naturally observing, not filming

### Angle Psychology: Honest Perspective
**Eye Level (75%)**
- **Rationale**: Equals, peer-to-peer communication
- **Psychology**: No power dynamics, respectful conversation
- **Trust**: "I'm talking to you, not down to you"

**Slight Low Angle (15%)**
- **Usage**: Only for product shots on shelves, storage areas
- **Subtle**: Just enough to show practical organization

**High Angle (10%)**
- **Usage**: Overhead shots of prep supplies, organization systems
- **Functional**: Shows how things actually work, not dramatic

---

## Lighting Architecture: Authentic Illumination

### Exposure Ratio: Honest Light
**2:1 Ratio (Primary)**
- **Rationale**: Soft, natural contrast - how eyes actually see
- **Psychology**: Approachable, non-threatening, comfortable
- **Technical**: Avoids dramatic shadows that feel staged

**3:1 Ratio (Selective)**
- **Usage**: Evening scenes, garage/basement prep areas
- **Natural**: Matches available light conditions
- **Limits**: Still readable, not moody

### Key Light Sources: Motivated Reality
**Window Light (Primary)**
- **Direction**: Side lighting from actual windows
- **Quality**: Soft, diffused through curtains/blinds
- **Rationale**: How preppers actually live and work

**Overhead Fluorescent/LED**
- **Usage**: Garage, basement, utility areas
- **Quality**: Slightly hard, realistic
- **Color**: Cool white (4000K-5000K) - practical work lighting

**Table/Desk Lamps**
- **Usage**: Evening planning, reading scenarios
- **Warmth**: 2700K-3000K tungsten feel
- **Intimate**: Family planning moments

### Atmospheric Elements: Subtle Realism
**Dust Particles (Minimal)**
- **Usage**: Only in sunbeam from windows
- **Subtlety**: Barely visible, natural environmental
- **Avoids**: Dramatic volumetric effects

**Natural Haze**
- **Sources**: Cooking steam, outside air, humidity
- **Function**: Adds depth without production value
- **Realism**: What's actually in the air

## Realism Requirements: Prepper Authenticity

### Skin Imperfections: Working Hands Aesthetic
**Essential Details:**
- **Visible pores**: Especially on nose, forehead in close-ups
- **Natural oil/sweat**: Slight sheen from work, not glamorous
- **Work-worn hands**: Calluses, slight staining, practical wear
- **Skin tone variation**: Natural blotchiness, sun exposure patterns
- **Facial hair**: Slight stubble growth, not perfect grooming

### Hair Details: Practical Styling
**Natural Elements:**
- **Stray hairs**: Escaped from ponytails, caps, practical styles
- **Texture variation**: Not salon-perfect, natural movement
- **Work aftermath**: Slightly messy from physical tasks
- **Practical cuts**: Functional lengths, not styled for cameras

### Clothing Realism: Functional Wear
**Authentic Details:**
- **Fabric wrinkles**: Especially at elbows, knees, sitting areas
- **Natural draping**: How clothes actually fall and move
- **Wear patterns**: Slight fading, practical use marks
- **Functional choices**: Cargo pants, work boots, practical fabrics

### Environmental Authenticity
**Home Details:**
- **Lived-in spaces**: Not perfectly clean, practical organization
- **Tool wear**: Scuffs on flashlights, wear on containers
- **Label aging**: Slight wear on product labels, not pristine
- **Natural lighting inconsistency**: Different bulbs, natural variations

## Color Science: Anti-Commercial Palette

### 60-30-10 Distribution: Practical Colors
**60% Dominant: Muted Earth Tones**
- **Palette**: Khaki, olive drab, brown, weathered gray
- **Rationale**: Military surplus aesthetic, practical gear colors
- **Psychology**: Serious, functional, non-flashy

**30% Secondary: Functional Accents**
- **Palette**: Navy blue, forest green, charcoal
- **Sources**: Work clothing, storage containers, practical gear
- **Balance**: Supports earth tones without competing

**10% Accent: Safety & Alert Colors**
- **Palette**: Orange (safety gear), yellow (labels), red (emergency)
- **Function**: Practical warning colors, not decorative
- **Usage**: Flashlight beams, emergency equipment, warning labels

### Temperature Balance: Natural Light Mix
**Warm/Cool Ratio: 40/60**
- **Warm (40%)**: Evening/indoor family scenes
- **Cool (60%)**: Daytime work areas, storage spaces
- **Motivation**: Follows natural light patterns
- **Avoids**: Artificial color grading that feels processed

### Color Psychology: Trust Building
**Avoid**: Saturated marketing colors, perfect white balance
**Embrace**: Slight color casts from real lighting conditions
**Goal**: "This is how it actually looks" credibility

## Scene Segmentation & Continuation Strategy

### 8-Second Segment Structure
**Segment Planning for Extended Content:**

**Scene 1a (0-8s): Vulnerability Discovery**
- Setup: Father checking emergency supplies
- Continuation Point: Last frame shows father's concerned expression
- Prompt Consistency: Maintain character description exactly

**Scene 1b (8-16s): Problem Recognition**
- Continue: Same father, same location, 85% identical prompt
- Change: Discovers water supply issue
- Frame Connection: Use father's expression as starting point

**Scene 2a (16-24s): Solution Introduction**
- New Shot: Different angle, but same environment
- Transition: Natural cut, not frame continuation
- Character: Same father, same clothing state

**Scene 2b (24-32s): Product Interaction**
- Continue: From 2a using frame continuation method
- Action: Father examining H2O Pure bottle
- Consistency: 85% prompt similarity maintained

### 85/15 Continuation Rule Application
**85% Consistent Elements:**
- Character physical description (age, build, clothing)
- Lighting conditions and environment
- Camera specifications and angle
- Atmospheric conditions

**15% Variable Elements:**
- Specific action/gesture
- Facial expression
- Hand position
- Object interaction

### Frame Extraction Strategy
**Technical Implementation:**
- Extract final frame at 7.5s mark (0.5s buffer)
- Use as `--image` input for continuation segment
- Maintain prompt structure with action evolution
- Plan 1-2 second trim overlap for smooth editing

## Audio Strategy: Post-Production Control

### No Narration Rule
**Production**: Generate videos without voiceover
**Post**: Add professional narration for perfect control
**Benefits**: No cutoff issues, consistent pacing, message precision

### Character Dialogue Limits
**On-Screen Speaking**: Maximum 10 words if characters talk
**Focus**: Ambient sounds, environmental audio
**Examples**: "This should work" / "Let me check" / "Perfect"

### Ambient Sound Planning
**Environment**: Household sounds, outdoor ambience
**Actions**: Paper rustling, container opening, footsteps
**Atmosphere**: Realistic sound bed for authenticity
