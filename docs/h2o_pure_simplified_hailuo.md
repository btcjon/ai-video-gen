## ðŸŽ¬ Complete Production Workflow

### Image Generation Strategy
1. **Scene 1 only:** Generate BOTH starting and ending images (2 images total)
2. **Scenes 2-6:** Use previous scene's ending as starting frame, only generate NEW ending image (5 images total)
3. **Total images needed:** 7 images (not 12!)

### Scene-by-Scene Process

**Scene 1:**
- Generate starting image
- Generate ending image  
- Upload both to Hailuo with Scene 1 prompt
- Generate 6-second video

**Scenes 2-6:**
- Download/save ending frame from previous scene
- Generate only the NEW ending image for current scene
- Upload previous ending + new ending to Hailuo
- Generate 6-second video

### Assembly Tips
- Minimal crossfades needed (0.1-0.2 seconds) since frames already match
- Add film grain overlay (2-5% opacity)
- Subtle chromatic aberration on edges
- Color grade: 70% desaturation with orange/teal split
- Audio: Layer ambient sounds + subtle music + dialogue where needed

## ðŸ“Š Production Timeline

| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Generate Scene 1 images (2 images) | 15 min |

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Success Factors

### Image Prompt Quality
âœ… **Simple, achievable descriptions** - avoid overly complex scenes
âœ… **Consistent character details** - copy/paste core description
âœ… **Realistic props** - water jug, small bottle, backpack (common items)
âœ… **Natural lighting** - golden hour, moonlight (AI understands well)
âœ… **Clear composition** - describe exactly what's in frame

### Hailuo Prompt Structure (From Tutorial)
âœ… **[Camera Shot]** - specific movement and framing
âœ… **[Subject]** - detailed character and prop descriptions  
âœ… **[Action]** - second-by-second breakdown
âœ… **[Scene]** - environment and background details
âœ… **[Lighting]** - specific light sources and quality
âœ… **[Style/Mood]** - overall aesthetic and emotion

### Frame Continuation
âœ… Ending pose flows logically into next scene's action
âœ… Lighting transitions make sense (sunset â†’ night)
âœ… Character position evolves naturally
âœ… Props maintain consistency across scenes

---

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips from Tutorial

1. **Be hyper-specific about character** - use exact same description every time
2. **Break action into seconds** - "At 2 seconds... At 4 seconds..."
3. **Avoid overly complex prompts** - simpler often works better
4. **Ground in reality** - realistic settings over fantastical
5. **Use natural language** - conversational paragraph style, not bullet points
6. **Add "(no subtitles)" at end** - prevents text rendering issues
