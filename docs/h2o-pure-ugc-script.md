## COMPLETE SCRIPT (45-60 SECOND VERSION)

**[0-5s] HOOK:**
"I had no idea our tap water could make my kids sick until the boil advisory hit... and we had nothing."
**Visual**: Extreme close-up, concerned but not dramatic expression, direct eye contact
**B-roll**: None (pure face-to-camera for connection)

**[5-12s] PERSONAL INTRO:**
"I'm that mom who always thinks 'it won't happen to us'—until it did. Power outage, water advisory, three kids asking for water, and I'm staring at two bottles in the fridge. That was my wake-up call."
**Visual**: Face-to-camera, relatable frustration mixed with embarrassment
**B-roll**: None (maintain connection)

**[12-25s] PROBLEM AMPLIFICATION:**
"I looked into those big water filters—like $200, take up half your counter, need electricity. Camping filters? Bulky, break easy, pain to use. I wanted something simple that actually worked and didn't require me to become a survivalist. Everything I found was either complicated, expensive, or both."
**Visual**: Expressive frustration (genuine, not theatrical)
**B-roll**: Quick flash of bulky filter system (2s), camping pump filter (2s)

**[25-32s] PRODUCT INTRODUCTION:**
"Then my sister-in-law showed me these H2O Pure drops. I'm holding the bottle right now—it's smaller than my thumb and weighs basically nothing. I thought, 'There's no way this works.' She said, 'Just try it.'"
**Visual**: Hold bottle in palm to show size, skeptical but intrigued expression
**B-roll**: None (focus on product reveal)

**[32-45s] EXPERIENCE & BENEFITS:**
"Eight drops per gallon, wait one hour, and it's lab-proven safe. Kills E. coli, Salmonella, all the scary stuff. This tiny bottle treats 15 gallons—that's a month of emergency water for my family. I tested it on camping trip water that looked questionable. No weird taste. No one got sick. It just works."
**Visual**: Demonstrate drops going into water bottle, genuine relief/confidence
**B-roll**: Pour drops into water (close-up), show family drinking water outdoors, product closeup showing label

**[45-52s] DIFFERENTIATION:**
"What makes this different is it's natural—copper and zinc minerals, 99% natural formula. Not harsh chemicals like those iodine tablets that taste horrible. No moving parts to break. No batteries. Just drops that actually purify water."
**Visual**: Hold bottle confidently, show back label briefly
**B-roll**: Quick shot of clear treated water

**[52-60s] SOCIAL PROOF + FIRST CTA:**
"Made in USA, lab-tested, 30-day money-back guarantee. I keep one in my car, one in my emergency kit, one in my hiking pack. Link in bio—under $30, treats 15+ gallons for like 3 cents each. If you've got kids or go camping or just want to be prepared, get this. Seriously."
**Visual**: Show multiple bottles in different locations (car glovebox, backpack), confident smile
**B-roll**: Quick product shot with "Made in USA" visible, link graphic overlay
**Text Overlay**: "Under $30 | 15+ Gallons | Lab-Proven Safe"

**[OPTIONAL 60-75s EXTENSION - OBJECTION + FINAL CTA]:**
"I know—I was skeptical too. 'How can drops this small work?' They're literally lab-certified to eliminate bacteria and pathogens. And yes, it's safe for kids and pets. Link below, grab one before the next emergency. I wish I'd had this years ago."
**Visual**: Return to close-up, reassuring expression, point to link
**Text Overlay**: "Lab-Certified | Safe for All Ages | Link Below ↓"

- **Volume**: 20% max (voice is hero, music is support)
- **Style**: Acoustic indie or soft electronic (approachable, not dramatic)

### Caption Mandate:
- Auto-generate with CapCut, manually clean

## CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION NOTES

### Applied Psychological Triggers:
1. **Fear (Family Safety)** - Used at 0-12s: Tap water advisory story creates urgency through parental protection instinct
2. **Relief (Simple Solution)** - Used at 32-45s: Tiny bottle solves complex problem = satisfying contrast
3. **Empowerment (Self-Reliance)** - Used at 45-60s: Being prepared creates confidence and control
4. **Validation (Smart Discovery)** - Used throughout: "I thought the same thing you're thinking" creates trust
5. **Confidence (Preparedness)** - Used at 52-60s: Multiple bottles in different places shows transformation from anxious to ready

### Platform-Specific Adaptations:
- **TikTok**: Use 45-second version (faster pacing, immediate hook, single CTA at 45s)
- **Instagram Reels**: Use 60-second version (slightly more B-roll, emphasis on lifestyle integration)
- **Both**: Vertical 9:16 format, captions mandatory, fast cut during problem (12-25s), slower during benefits (32-52s)

### Objection Handling:
- **Primary objection: "Does it really work?"** - Addressed at 32-45s with lab-proven certification + real-world camping test
- **Secondary objection: "Is it safe for my kids?"** - Addressed at 60-75s extension with "safe for all ages and pets"
- **Tertiary objection: "Too good to be true"** - Addressed throughout with skepticism shield ("I thought the same thing") + money-back guarantee

### Key Metrics to Track:
- **Hook rate (% past 3s)** - Target: 55%+ (fear-based hooks perform well with parents)
- **Hold rate (% to CTA at 52s)** - Target: 35%+ (problem-solution fit is strong)
- **Click-through rate** - Target: 8-12% (emergency prep audience converts well)
- **Conversion rate** - Target: 4-10% (low price point + high perceived value)

### A/B Testing Recommendations:
1. **HIGHEST IMPACT: Test Hook 1 vs Hook 3 vs Hook 4** (parent angle vs prepper angle vs curiosity angle)
2. **Test script length**: 45s version vs 60s version (completion rate will determine winner)
3. **Test CTA urgency**: "Link in bio" vs "Link in bio—grab one before next emergency" (urgency modifier)
4. **Test social proof placement**: Current position (52s) vs earlier (38s after differentiation)

## CTA VARIATIONS TO TEST

### Primary CTA (52-60s):
- **Version 1 (Current)**: "Link in bio—under $30, treats 15+ gallons for like 3 cents each. If you've got kids or go camping or just want to be prepared, get this. Seriously."
- **Version 2 (Urgency)**: "Link below. Under $30. Next time there's a storm warning or water advisory, you'll actually be ready. Don't wait until you need it—grab it now."
- **Version 3 (Value Focus)**: "Link in bio. Costs less than a month of bottled water, lasts way longer, takes zero space. This is the smart move."

### Final CTA (60-75s Extension):
- **Version 1 (Current)**: "Link below, grab one before the next emergency. I wish I'd had this years ago."
- **Version 2 (Friend Advice)**: "Do yourself a favor—click that link right now. When you need clean water and you have this in your bag, you'll thank me."

## ALTERNATIVE 30-SECOND RAPID VERSION (TikTok Optimized)

For maximum completion rate on TikTok, here's a condensed version:

**[0-3s] HOOK:**
"I had no idea tap water could make my kids sick until the boil advisory hit and we had nothing."

**[3-10s] PROBLEM → SOLUTION:**
"I looked at those $200 filters—way too complicated. Then I found H2O Pure drops. This bottle weighs less than a nickel, treats 15 gallons, and it's lab-proven to kill E. coli and Salmonella."

**[10-20s] EXPERIENCE + DIFFERENTIATION:**
"Eight drops, wait one hour, safe water. I tested it camping—no weird taste, no one got sick. It's 99% natural, not harsh chemicals. Made in USA, under $30."

**[20-30s] CTA:**
"I keep one in my car, one in my emergency kit, one in my hiking pack. Link below—3 cents per gallon, 30-day guarantee. If you've got kids or want to be prepared, get this now."

**Visual Strategy**: Face-to-camera 60%, product demonstration 40%, fast cuts every 3-4 seconds during problem/solution, slower during CTA

3. **Editing (60-90 min)**: Assemble best takes, add B-roll, auto-caption + manual cleanup, text overlays, music, color correction
4. **Review (15 min)**: Watch 3 times (sound on, sound off with captions, on phone screen), make final tweaks
5. **Upload (15 min)**: Export, write caption, add hashtags, verify link in bio, post at optimal time
