## The Ultimate Prompt Formula

### 10 Essential Components (Use ALL of These)

```
[1. SCENE SETUP] + [2. SUBJECT DESCRIPTION] + [3. BACKGROUND] + 
[4. ACTION] + [5. VIDEO STYLE] + [6. CAMERA SETTINGS] + 
[7. COMPOSITION] + [8. LIGHTING & MOOD] + [9. AUDIO] + 
[10. NEGATIVE INSTRUCTIONS]
```

### Claude Auto-Prompt Template (Copy & Use)

```
Expand it into a full Veo 3 prompt using this structure: 

1. Scene Summary ‚Äì Rewrite my brief as a cinematic moment in one clear sentence. 
2. Subject ‚Äì Describe the main subject(s) in rich detail (appearance, clothing, physical features). 
3. Background & Context ‚Äì Expand the setting/environment for my idea. 
4. Action ‚Äì Describe what's happening, based on my brief, with realistic movement. 
5. Style & Aesthetic ‚Äì Always cinematic, photorealistic, professional film look, high detail. 
6. Camera Instructions ‚Äì Add shot type (close-up, wide shot, POV, aerial, etc.), movement (dolly, pan, tracking), and angle (eye-level, low/high). 
7. Composition & Framing ‚Äì Professional framing that emphasizes the subject clearly. 
8. Lighting & Mood ‚Äì Realistic cinematic lighting to match the mood (golden hour, moody, neon, etc.). 
9. Audio ‚Äì Add dialogue/ambient sounds/effects that fit the scene. Always add (no subtitles). 
10. Color Palette ‚Äì Cohesive cinematic tones that enhance mood. 
11. Negative Instructions ‚Äì Avoid subtitles, distortions, unrealistic proportions, flickering, or extra characters not in the brief. 

Expand it into a full Veo 3 prompt, but write it as one continuous cinematic paragraph (not bullet points, no section labels).

[YOUR SIMPLE IDEA HERE]
```

**Key**: Replace `[YOUR SIMPLE IDEA HERE]` with your concept and get a perfect VEO 3 prompt every time.

## Critical Success Principles

### üéØ The Golden Rules

**1. Never Use Simple Prompts**
- ‚ùå "knight riding horse"
- ‚úÖ "silver armored knight on black horse riding through misty forest at dawn, cinematic wide shot with dramatic lighting"

**2. Always Include Negative Instructions**
- Essential phrase: "No subtitles, no distortions, no unrealistic proportions, no flickering, no extra characters"
- Prevents 80% of common failures

**3. Specify Everything**
- Time of day (golden hour, sunset, midnight)
- Camera movement (dolly in, pan right, tracking shot)
- Lighting style (soft natural light, dramatic shadows, neon glow)
- Audio cues (spoken dialogue, ambient sounds, music)

**4. Write Continuous Paragraphs**
- VEO 3 processes flowing narrative better than bullet points
- Avoid labeled sections in final prompt

---

## Vertical Video (Social Media) Mastery

### The Working Formula for 9:16 Content

```
A close-up vertically framed portrait video of [SUBJECT] standing in the center 
of the frame, captured in vertical mode, cinematic lighting, sharp focus, 
shallow depth of field, 9:16 aspect ratio. [SUBJECT ACTION]. Optimized for 
[PLATFORM] with [ENERGY LEVEL] energy and mobile-optimized composition.
```

### Platform-Specific Optimizations

**TikTok**:
- High energy, dynamic movement
- "Trending viral style with engaging visuals"
- Centered composition with clear subject

**Instagram Reels**:
- Polished aesthetic, premium feel
- "Instagram-worthy framing with visual appeal"
- Smooth progression throughout

**YouTube Shorts**:
- Clear narrative, informative
- "Educational-friendly with good readability"
- Balanced energy, clear visual hierarchy

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Post-Production Reality
- VEO 3 outputs 16:9 by default (even with vertical prompts)
- Solution: Create vertically-framed content within 16:9, then crop in editing
- Check if subject is centered and tight before cropping

## Character Consistency for Long Videos

### The Professional Method: Custom AI Models

**Step 1: Create Character Dataset**
1. Start with one high-quality character image
2. Use VEO 3 "Frames to Video" with prompt: "turns and looks around"
3. Extract 10+ screenshots using Frame Extractor tool
4. Save multiple angles: front, side, 3/4 view

**Step 2: Train Custom Model (OpenArt)**
1. Upload dataset to OpenArt Characters feature
2. Name your character (e.g., "Marcus")
3. Train model (~10 minutes)
4. Generate unlimited consistent images

**Step 3: Generate Videos with Consistency**
- Use custom model images as video starting frames
- Keep character description identical across all prompts
- Example structure: `[CONSISTENT CHARACTER DESC] + [NEW ACTION] + [NEW BACKGROUND]`

**Step 4: Voice Consistency (11 Labs)**
- Export audio from VEO 3 videos
- Use 11 Labs Voice Changer for consistent character voice
- Replace inconsistent VEO 3 audio with unified voice

### Quick Character Consistency (No Training)

**Claude Character Split Method**:
1. Generate full scene prompt
2. Ask Claude: "Split the prompt into character and action"
3. Result: Reusable character description + variable actions
4. Use same character desc for all scenes, change only actions

---

## Creating Longer Videos: Scene Continuation Technique

### The 8-Second Problem

**VEO 3 Limitation**: Maximum 8-second clips  
**Solution**: Frame-to-video continuation for seamless longer content

### The Frame Continuation Method

**Core Principle**: Use the last frame of Scene 1 as the starting image for Scene 2

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ Maintains character consistency automatically
- ‚úÖ Preserves environment and lighting
- ‚úÖ Creates natural flow between scenes
- ‚úÖ Avoids jarring cuts or character changes

### The 85/15 Rule for Continuations

**Keep 85% Identical Between Scenes**:
- Same character description (exact wording)
- Same environment details
- Same lighting setup and mood
- Same camera angle and framing

**Change Only 15%**:
- The specific action/movement
- Minor prop additions (if needed)
- Slight camera movement (if necessary)

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Generate Initial Scene**
```json
{
  "scene": "Scene 1 - Introduction",
  "prompt": "45-year-old father with salt-and-pepper hair checking emergency supplies in dimly lit garage, worried expression, wearing gray t-shirt, cinematic lighting with 2:1 ratio, handheld camera, shallow depth of field"
}
```

**Step 2: Extract Last Frame**
- Download completed video
- Extract final frame as PNG/JPG
- Save as starting point for next scene

**Step 3: Generate Continuation (85% Same)**
```json
{
  "scene": "Scene 2 - Continuation",
  "starting_image": "scene1_last_frame.png",
  "prompt": "45-year-old father with salt-and-pepper hair finding water bottle among emergency supplies in dimly lit garage, relieved expression, wearing gray t-shirt, cinematic lighting with 2:1 ratio, handheld camera, shallow depth of field"
}
```

**Notice**: Only changed "checking" ‚Üí "finding water bottle" and "worried" ‚Üí "relieved"

### Scene Segmentation Strategy

**Break Your Story into 8-Second Chunks**:
```
0:00-0:08  Scene 1a: Establish crisis/problem
0:08-0:16  Scene 1b: Continue - character reacts
0:16-0:24  Scene 2a: Introduce solution/product  
0:24-0:32  Scene 2b: Continue - demonstrate solution
0:32-0:40  Scene 3a: Show transformation/results
0:40-0:48  Scene 3b: Continue - final impact
```

### Transition Management

**Expect 1-2 Second "Jump"**:
- Generate 10-second clips when possible
- Use middle 8 seconds in editing
- Trim awkward transition frames
- Add subtle crossfade if needed (0.5s)

**Pro Tip**: Generate slightly longer than needed, trim to smoothest section

### Practical Example: Product Commercial

**Traditional Approach (Disconnected)**:
- 4 separate scenes √ó 8s = 32 seconds
- Different angles, inconsistent look
- Character appearance varies

**Continuous Approach (Professional)**:
```
Scene 1a (0-8s):   Man at window watching crisis unfold
Scene 1b (8-16s):  [FROM 1a] Man turning to check supplies
Scene 2a (16-24s): [FROM 1b] Man in garage discovering problem
Scene 2b (24-32s): [FROM 2a] Man finding product solution
Scene 3a (32-40s): [NEW SHOT] Hands demonstrating product
Scene 3b (40-48s): [FROM 3a] Product working, water clearing
Scene 4a (48-56s): [NEW SHOT] Family gathering with product
Scene 4b (56-64s): [FROM 4a] Family satisfied, drinking water
```

**Result**: 64 seconds of seamless narrative vs 32 seconds of disconnected clips

### When to Start Fresh vs Continue

**Use Frame Continuation When**:
- ‚úÖ Same character in same location
- ‚úÖ Sequential action/story beat
- ‚úÖ Maintaining emotional continuity
- ‚úÖ Same time of day/lighting

**Start Fresh When**:
- ‚úÖ Location change (garage ‚Üí kitchen)
- ‚úÖ Time jump (day ‚Üí night)
- ‚úÖ Different character/angle needed
- ‚úÖ Major scene transition

### Technical Implementation

**With Image-to-Video Feature**:
```
1. Generate Scene 1 normally
2. Download video when complete
3. Extract last frame (use video editor or:
   ffmpeg -sseof -1 -i video.mp4 -frames:v 1 last_frame.png)
4. Upload last_frame.png as starting image
5. Use 85% same prompt with 15% action change
6. Generate Scene 2
```

**Claude Code Prompt for Continuation**:
```
I have this scene prompt:
[PASTE SCENE 1 PROMPT]

Create a continuation prompt that:
- Keeps 85% identical (character, environment, lighting, camera)
- Changes only the action to: [NEW ACTION]
- Maintains exact same character description
- Preserves lighting and mood
```

### Cost Optimization

**Standard Approach**: 4 scenes √ó $0.38 = $1.52 (32 seconds)  
**Continuous Approach**: 8 segments √ó $0.38 = $3.04 (64 seconds)

**Value**: 2√ó length, professional flow, seamless narrative = Worth the investment

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Character looks different in continuation  
**Solution**: Copy/paste exact character description, use last frame as starting image

**Issue**: Lighting/environment changes  
**Solution**: Include specific lighting details in both prompts identically

**Issue**: Jumpy transitions even with continuation  
**Solution**: Generate 10s clips, trim first/last seconds where jump occurs

**Issue**: Lost track of prompt variations  
**Solution**: Document each scene with exact prompt used, build template library

### Quick Implementation Checklist

Before starting scene continuation:
- [ ] Break story into 8-second beats
- [ ] Identify which scenes need continuation
- [ ] Write Scene 1 with complete character/environment details
- [ ] Generate Scene 1 and extract last frame
- [ ] Copy Scene 1 prompt, change only action (15%)
- [ ] Use last frame as starting image for Scene 2
- [ ] Test with veo3_fast first (20 credits)
- [ ] Plan for 1-2 second transition trimming in post

### Pro Tips for Seamless Continuations

1. **Action Continuity**: End Scene 1 mid-movement, continue that movement in Scene 2
2. **Eye-Line Match**: Keep character looking same direction between scenes
3. **Audio Bridge**: Use consistent ambient sound to mask visual transitions
4. **Micro-Movements**: Small actions (turning head, reaching) work better for continuations
5. **Safety Overlap**: Generate slight action overlap to give editing flexibility

## Photorealistic Character Creation

### The Imperfection Principle

**Critical Rule**: AI defaults to unrealistic perfection. True realism requires **intentional imperfections**.

‚ùå **What AI Defaults To**: Ultra-realistic texture overload, perfect skin, flawless hair  
‚úÖ **What Looks Real**: Scars, pores, stray hairs, uneven skin tone, natural asymmetry

### Essential Character Details (Use Claude Code Bot)

**Create a Claude Code subagent with this prompt structure**:
```
I need a detailed character description for VEO 3. Ask me questions about:
1. Age, gender, ethnicity, facial features, body type
2. Skin imperfections: pores, sweat, oil, dirt, marks, cuts, scars, acne
3. Eye details: color, tints, eyelid position, wrinkles, crow's feet
4. Mouth/lips: condition, dryness, texture, natural asymmetry
5. Hair: thin/thick, color, cleanliness, messiness, stray strands
6. Emotional tone and facial expression
7. Clothing: texture, material, style, wear patterns, imperfections
8. Defining human traits that make them unique

Then provide a comprehensive VEO 3 prompt paragraph.
```

### Critical Focus Areas (Where Humans Look)

**1. Eyes (Primary Human Focus)**
- Specify: color, subtle tints, eyelid positions
- Include: surrounding wrinkles, crow's feet, under-eye texture
- Rule: "If an eye looks off, the entire image feels off"

**2. Mouth & Lips (Dialogue Authenticity)**
- Detail: lip condition, dryness, texture, natural asymmetry  
- Critical during: any scene with dialogue or speaking
- Rule: Viewers watch mouths during dialogue to verify authenticity

**3. Skin Texture (Realism Foundation)**
- Always include: visible pores, sweat, oil, dirt
- Add imperfections: marks, cuts, uneven tone
- Avoid: AI's default "perfect skin" which looks fake

**4. Hair (The Detail Differentiator)**
- Specify: thin/thick quality, exact color, messiness level
- Always add: stray strands even in "clean" hairstyles
- Prevents: AI's polished, unrealistic hair defaults

### Advanced Lighting for Realism

**Lighting Specification Structure**:
```
[Natural/Artificial] + [Quality: hard/soft] + [Direction] + 
[Shadow type] + [Motivation] + [Exposure ratio]
```

**Exposure Ratios for Cinematic Look**:
- **2:1 or 4:1**: Soft contrast, professional look (RECOMMENDED)
- **1:1**: Flat lighting, no shadows (avoid)
- **32:1**: Harsh contrast, dramatic shadows (use sparingly)

**Example**:
"Soft natural lighting from window left, creating 2:1 exposure ratio with gentle shadows, motivated by golden hour sun"

### Atmospheric Realism Elements

**Add Light Interaction Physics**:
- Dust particles in light beams
- Atmospheric haze or mist
- Heat wave distortion (outdoor scenes)
- Volumetric god rays through windows

**Why It Works**: Shows how light interacts with environment, adding depth and authenticity

### Camera Technical Specifications

**Frame Rate & Settings**:
- Shutter speed: "1/50 for natural motion blur"
- ISO: "ISO 800 for slight grain" (adds texture)
- Depth of field: "Shallow DOF at F2.8" or "Deep focus at F16"

**Lens Character**:
- Vintage lenses: "Vintage Helios lens character"
- Telephoto: "85mm telephoto compression"
- Anamorphic: "Anamorphic lens flares and bokeh"
- Mobile aesthetic: "iPhone 15 Pro Max handheld footage"

**Aperture Guide**:
- **F1.4**: Maximum bokeh, extreme blur
- **F2.8-F4**: Balanced cinematic look (RECOMMENDED)
- **F8-F11**: Sharp environmental detail
- **F16-F22**: Everything in focus (landscapes)

### Color Palette Control (60-30-10 Rule)

**Professional Color Distribution**:
- **60%**: Dominant color (background, main environment)
- **30%**: Secondary color (supporting elements)
- **10%**: Accent pops (highlights, key details)

**Example**: "Color palette: 60% muted blue-gray tones, 30% warm amber lighting, 10% vibrant red accent on subject's jacket"

### Advanced Prompting with Claude Code

**Step 1: Image Analysis (Upload existing reference)**
```
Analyze this image using JSON breakdown. Identify:
- Character details and imperfections
- Lighting setup and exposure ratio
- Color palette distribution (60-30-10)
- Camera settings and lens character
- Atmospheric elements present

Then enhance the prompt for better realism.
```

**Step 2: Enhanced Generation**
Claude Code will provide improved prompt with specific imperfections and technical details

## Commercial-Quality Videos (Use JSON Prompting)

### Why JSON Prompting Works

**The Core Principle**: JSON transforms vague ideas into precise production briefs.

‚ùå **What Most People Do**: "A forest at sunset" (hoping for cinematic results)  
‚úÖ **What Professionals Do**: "Give me a drone shot of misty pine forest at golden hour, 2:1 exposure ratio, slow ascending movement, volumetric god rays, ambient forest sounds"

**The Reality**: 
- Most AI video failures come from **inadequate prompting**, not AI limitations
- VEO 3 understands camera movement, lighting, sound design, and storytelling‚Äîyou just need to speak its language
- **If you're getting mid results, it's your prompt, not the model**

### JSON = Production Brief (Not Rough Ideas)

**Think Like a Director**:
- You're not describing a video‚Äîyou're **designing an experience**
- JSON provides the complete production brief a film crew would need
- Specificity = The difference between amateur and professional results

**What JSON Controls**:
- Lighting style and motivation
- Camera angles, movements, speeds
- Scene composition and framing
- Motion details and timing
- Audio textures and ambience
- Emotional tone and atmosphere
- Product/subject presentation details

### Three-Step Claude Code Workflow for JSON

**Step 1: Generate Optimized Concept**
```
Create a commercial ad concept for [BRAND] featuring [PRODUCT] with [CONCEPT]. 
Think like a creative director planning a $100,000 commercial.
Include all production details: lighting, camera, motion, audio, atmosphere.
```

**Step 2: Convert to JSON Structure**
```
Convert this commercial concept into JSON prompt format with these fields:
- description (overview of the scene)
- style (specific commercial aesthetic - be exact: "Apple minimalist" or "Nike high-energy")
- camera (movement types, angles, specific technical specs)
- lighting (setup, ratios, motivation, quality)
- environment (setting details, atmosphere, background)
- [product-specific] (liquid_dynamics, wardrobe_details, product_details, etc.)
- motion (specific movements, timing, speed)
- audio (sounds, music, ambience - be specific)
- emotional_tone (what should the viewer feel?)
- timing (if specific beats or pacing matter)

Make it detailed like a real production brief.
```

**Step 3: Feed to VEO 3**
Copy the JSON structure directly into VEO 3 prompt field. The structured format gives VEO 3 the complete production blueprint it needs.

### JSON Template Strategy

**The Power of Templates**:
- Create once, reuse infinitely with modifications
- Swap products, styles, settings while keeping structure
- Build a library of proven templates for different use cases

**Template Customization**:
```json
// Base Template: Product Reveal
{
  "description": "[SWAP PRODUCT] floating on dark background",
  "style": "[SWAP BRAND AESTHETIC] commercial style",
  "camera": {
    "movement": "[KEEP OR MODIFY] slow rotation",
    "angles": "[ADJUST AS NEEDED] dramatic angles"
  },
  // ... rest of structure remains consistent
}
```

### JSON vs Paragraph Prompting

| Aspect | JSON Prompting | Paragraph Prompting |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Best For** | Commercial work, precise control | General content, quick generation |
| **Precision** | Extremely high - production brief level | Moderate - creative description |
| **Learning Curve** | Steeper - requires production knowledge | Easier - natural language |
| **Output Quality** | $100K commercial look | Professional but less controlled |
| **Use Case** | Client work, brand content, advertising | Social media, personal projects |
| **VEO 3 Response** | Responds like receiving director's brief | Interprets creative description |
| **Recommended For** | When every detail matters | 90% of everyday video creation |

### Critical JSON Insights

**1. Specificity = Professional Results**
- Vague: "nice lighting" ‚Üí Specific: "soft golden hour with 2:1 exposure ratio, backlit with rim light"
- Vague: "camera moves" ‚Üí Specific: "slow dolly in from medium to close-up over 5 seconds"

**2. Production Concepts Matter**
- Understanding lighting ratios, camera movements, and timing is what separates pro from amateur
- You don't need equipment anymore‚Äîyou need knowledge

**3. JSON Bridges Human Vision to AI Execution**
- It's a shared language between your creative intent and VEO 3's capabilities
- Structured data matches AI's computational nature with human creative requirements

**Bottom Line**: Use JSON for commercial/professional work where precision matters. Use paragraph prompts (Claude template) for everything else.

### Commercial Video Types
- Product assembly/unboxing
- Brand storytelling
- Social media campaigns
- Client deliverables ($500-1000+ per video)

## The 15 Most Powerful Tips

### Prompting Excellence

**1. Think Like a Director, Not a Typist**
- You have film director power through prompts
- Provide complete production briefs, not casual descriptions
- If it's not the model‚Äîit's your prompt

**2. Be Hyper-Specific**
- More descriptive = better results
- Include materials, textures, colors, emotions
- "Soft golden hour with 2:1 ratio" > "nice lighting"

**3. Use Cinematic Language**
- "Wide shot dolly in" > "camera moves forward"
- "Golden hour with warm tones" > "nice lighting"
- Speak the language VEO 3 understands

**4. Lock Style Early**
- First sentence sets the tone
- "Apple minimalist commercial" vs "Nike high-energy athletic"
- Be specific about brand aesthetics

**5. Design Experiences, Not Just Videos**
- Don't describe‚Äîdesign the complete viewer experience
- Include emotional journey, sensory details, atmosphere
- Think: What should the viewer feel?

**6. Repeat Key Elements**
- Want red armor? Say "red armor" twice
- Repetition reinforces important details

**7. Always Add "High Quality Audio"**
- Dramatically improves audio generation success rate
- Specify exact sounds: "gentle pour, ambient caf√©, subtle music"

### Technical Controls

**6. Plan for 8-Second Limit**
- Each clip is maximum 8 seconds
- Design action/dialogue to fit timeframe

**7. Storyboard First**
- Sketch shot sequence before generating
- Prevents wasted credits on unplanned content

**8. Use Consistent Naming**
- Same character names across clips: "Alex the pilot"
- Helps AI maintain character consistency

**9. Test Fast vs Quality**
- As of September 2025: minimal difference
- Test both modes for important shots

**10. Save Successful Prompts**
- Build personal library of what works
- Reuse proven formulas

### Advanced Techniques

**11. JSON for Precision Control**
- Use structured prompts for commercial work
- Provides exact specifications for camera, lighting, audio

**12. Impossible Camera Moves**
- Not limited by reality: "camera swooping through keyhole"
- Embrace surreal cinematography

**13. Add Text in Post**
- VEO 3 fails at text generation
- Always add titles/captions in editing

**14. Upload High-Quality Images**
- Image-to-video quality depends on source
- Low quality input = disappointing output

**15. Always Upscale**
- Use OpenArt upscale feature for 4K output
- Essential for professional results

## Camera Angles & Storytelling

### Angles Convey Meaning

**Low Angles** (Camera looking up):
- Suggests: Power, dominance, importance
- Use for: Hero shots, authority figures, moments of triumph
- Example: "Low angle shot looking up at subject, conveying strength and dominance"

**High Angles** (Camera looking down):
- Suggests: Vulnerability, weakness, insignificance  
- Use for: Defeated moments, showing scale, isolation
- Example: "High angle looking down on subject, emphasizing smallness and vulnerability"

**Eye-Level Angles**:
- Suggests: Equality, neutrality, documentary realism
- Use for: Conversations, relatable moments, natural scenes
- Example: "Eye-level shot creating intimate connection with subject"

**Dutch Angles** (Tilted):
- Suggests: Unease, chaos, disorientation
- Use for: Tension, psychological distress, action sequences
- Example: "Dutch angle with 15-degree tilt creating visual tension"

### Compositional Techniques

**Rule of Thirds**:
- Place subject on intersection points
- "Subject positioned on right third line, creating balanced composition"

**Centered Symmetry** (Wes Anderson Style):
- Perfect center framing with symmetrical elements
- "Wes Anderson-style centered symmetrical composition with balanced frame"

**Leading Lines**:
- Use environmental elements to guide eye to subject
- "Leading lines from road converging toward subject in distance"

## The Bottom Line

**Success Formula = Detailed Prompts + Intentional Imperfections + Proper Settings + Always Upscale**

### Core Principles:
1. **Use Claude template** for automatic prompt optimization (general content)
2. **Use JSON prompting** for commercial/professional work (precise control)
3. **Add intentional imperfections** (AI defaults to fake perfection)
4. **Specify exposure ratios** (2:1 or 4:1 for cinematic look)
5. **Include atmospheric elements** (dust, haze, light interaction)
6. **Define camera angles** for story meaning (low = power, high = vulnerability)
7. **Never skip negative instructions**
8. **Test with Fast mode** (20 credits) before Quality (100 credits)
9. **Always upscale to 4K**

### When to Use Which Method:

**üìù Paragraph Prompts (Claude Template)**:
- Social media content
- Personal projects  
- Quick generations
- General video creation
- 90% of your use cases

**üìä JSON Prompts (Structured)**:
- Commercial/advertising content
- Brand campaigns
- Client deliverables
- Product showcases
- Precise control requirements

**üé¨ Scene Continuation (Frame-to-Video)**:
- Long-form content (30+ seconds)
- Narrative storytelling
- Character-driven scenes
- Sequential action sequences
- Professional seamless flow

### Advanced Workflows:
- **Character consistency**: Train custom AI models (OpenArt) or use Claude character splitting method
- **Longer videos**: Use frame-to-video continuation with 85/15 rule (85% same prompt, 15% new action)
- **Vertical content**: Use vertical-optimized prompts, then crop in post
- **Post-production**: Add film grain + chromatic aberration to disguise AI origins
- **Voice replacement**: Use 11 Labs for consistent audio (optional for creator content)

### Remember:
**"We don't want it perfect. We want it real."**

True photorealism comes from intentional imperfections, not AI's default ultra-realistic texture overload. Focus on eyes, mouths, skin texture, and hair details‚Äîthese are where humans detect artificial content.

**For Longer Videos**: Use frame-to-video continuation. Extract last frame of Scene 1, use as starting image for Scene 2 with 85% identical prompt. Only change the specific action (15%).

**Use JSON prompting for commercial work** where precise control over every element matters. Use paragraph prompts with the Claude template for everything else.
