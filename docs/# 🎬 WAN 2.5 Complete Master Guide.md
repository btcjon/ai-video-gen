### Maintaining Continuity

- Use consistent lighting descriptions across shots
- Keep character details identical (clothing, appearance)
- Match camera style and movement types
- Maintain mood and tone throughout
- Use reference images for character consistency

### Audio Layering Strategy

Build immersive soundscapes:

**Layer 1 - Primary (Environmental)**
```

ends with slow orbit around subject"
```

### VFX Integration

Add effects for impact:
```
"Explosion VFX as car crashes through barrier, debris flying, slow-motion 
bullet time effect as character dives"
```
