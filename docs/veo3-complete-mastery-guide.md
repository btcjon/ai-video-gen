## Frame-to-Frame Workflow for Long Videos {#frame-to-frame-workflow}

### The 8-Second Reality

**VEO 3 Limitation**: Maximum 8-second clips (cannot be extended)
**Solution**: Frame-to-video continuation for seamless longer content

### üö® The 7 Critical Rules for Multi-Scene Success

#### 1. **FACE MUST BE VISIBLE IN ENDING FRAME**
**Why**: VEO 3 cannot maintain character consistency without facial reference.

- ‚ùå WRONG: Character walking away, back to camera, face obscured
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: Character in 3/4 profile or facing camera at scene end
- **Rule**: Always end scenes with face visible at chest level or closer

**Scene Ending Checklist**:
- [ ] Character's face clearly visible (not turned away)
- [ ] Face showing at chest level or closer (not distant)
- [ ] 3/4 profile minimum (full face preferred)
- [ ] Good lighting on face
- [ ] Expression visible

#### 2. **ONE ACTION PER 8-SECOND SCENE**
**Why**: Cramming multiple actions results incomplete execution.

- ‚ùå WRONG: "Walk to camp + arrive + interact + demonstrate" (4 actions)
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: "Walk to camp and arrive" (1 action) ‚Üí Next scene: "Interact and demonstrate" (1 action)
- **Rule**: Max 4 distinct 2-second steps per scene, all serving ONE primary action

**Action Density Formula**:
```
Scene 1: ONE action (8 seconds)
  0-2s: Setup
  2-6s: Main action
  6-8s: Completion/transition

NOT this:
Scene 1: FOUR actions (8 seconds)
  0-2s: Action A
  2-4s: Action B
  4-6s: Action C
  6-8s: Action D
  Result: None fully executed
```

#### 3. **MAINTAIN CONTINUITY BETWEEN SCENES**
**Why**: Skipping logical steps breaks visual flow.

- ‚ùå WRONG: Scene N ends sitting ‚Üí Scene N+1 starts standing at different location
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: Scene N ends sitting ‚Üí Scene N+1 starts sitting, then stands
- **Rule**: Ending state of Scene N = Starting state of Scene N+1

**Continuity Planning**:
```
Scene 3 ends: Man sitting by fire at night
Scene 4 must start: Man sitting by fire at night, then [new action]

NOT: Man already standing at camp (broken continuity)
```

#### 4. **USE JSON FOR COMPLEX SCENES**
**Why**: Plain text lacks structure and completeness checks.

- **Use JSON for**: Multiple characters, camera movements, precise lighting, interactions
- **Plain text OK for**: Simple single-character continuity scenes
- **Rule**: When in doubt about completeness, use JSON structure

#### 5. **PLAN TRANSITIONS, DON'T SKIP THEM**
**Why**: Major location/time changes need transition scenes.

- ‚ùå WRONG: Forest ‚Üí teleport to camp
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: Forest ‚Üí see lights ‚Üí walk toward lights ‚Üí arrive at camp (2-3 scenes)
- **Rule**: If ending and beginning don't match, add a transition scene

#### 6. **ESTABLISH ENVIRONMENTAL AESTHETICS AT TRANSITION**
**Why**: Major style changes (day‚Üínight, location shifts) need clear visual direction.

- ‚ùå WRONG: Scene 3 (sunset) ends vague ‚Üí Scene 4 (night) generates poor night look
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: Scene 3 ending explicitly describes complete night aesthetic

**Examples of Environmental Transition Descriptions**:

**Night Transition**:
```
"ending with deep blue twilight, first stars visible, silver moonlight 
beginning to illuminate scene, cool color temperature establishing night 
aesthetic"
```

**Dawn Transition**:
```
"ending with warm golden orange horizon, soft pink sky, warm color 
temperature, volumetric morning mist"
```

**Indoor‚ÜíOutdoor**:
```
"ending with natural daylight flooding in, warm vs cool contrast, 
clear weather conditions visible through opening"
```

**Rule**: The scene where transition HAPPENS must end with complete aesthetic description.

#### 7. **PRODUCT VISIBILITY THROUGHOUT CHAIN** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
**Why**: Once product disappears, VEO 3 cannot accurately recreate it.

**The Product Continuity Problem**:
- VEO 3 cannot recreate branded products (logos, labels, specific designs)
- If product exits frame ‚Üí Next scene hallucines incorrect product or omits it
- Manual compositing is time-consuming and may not match lighting/angle

**Strategy A: Keep Product Visible (Preferred)**
```
‚úÖ Scene 2: Character discovers product ‚Üí holds in hands
‚úÖ Scene 3: Still holding product, adds drops to water jug
‚úÖ Scene 4: Product visible beside character during wait
‚úÖ Scene 5: Picks up product again to demonstrate
```
- **Rule**: Product must be visible in EVERY ending frame
- Either held by character OR positioned prominently in scene

**Strategy B: Plan for Manual Compositing**
```
‚úÖ Scene 2: Character examines generic bottle
   Ending frame: Bottle at chest level, clear view, good lighting
   ‚Üí Manually composite real product in post
‚úÖ Scene 3: Use composited ending frame as starting point
```

**Ending Frame Requirements for Compositing**:
- [ ] Product in clear, unobstructed view
- [ ] Good lighting on product area
- [ ] Angle suitable for placement (not extreme perspective)
- [ ] Character's hand position/grip visible

**Common Mistakes**:
- ‚ùå Scene 2 ends with product ‚Üí Scene 3 starts without product
- ‚ùå Product too small/obscured in ending frame
- ‚ùå Product at extreme angle in ending
- ‚ùå Assuming VEO 3 can recreate branded product from description

### The Frame Continuation Method

**Core Principle**: Use last frame of Scene 1 as starting image for Scene 2

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ Maintains character consistency automatically
- ‚úÖ Preserves environment and lighting
- ‚úÖ Creates natural flow between scenes
- ‚úÖ Avoids jarring cuts or character changes

### The 85/15 Rule for Continuations

**Keep 85% Identical Between Scenes**:
- Same character description (exact wording)
- Same environment details
- Same lighting setup and mood
- Same camera angle and framing

**Change Only 15%**:
- The specific action/movement
- Minor prop additions (if needed)
- Slight camera movement (if necessary)

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Generate Initial Scene**
```json
{
  "scene": "Scene 1 - Introduction",
  "prompt": "45-year-old father with salt-and-pepper hair checking emergency 
  supplies in dimly lit garage, worried expression, wearing gray t-shirt, 
  cinematic lighting with 2:1 ratio, handheld camera, shallow depth of field"
}
```

**Step 2: Extract Last Frame**
```bash
# FFmpeg method
ffmpeg -sseof -1 -i scene1.mp4 -vframes 1 scene1_ending.jpg

# Or extract at specific timestamp (7.9s for 8s video)
ffmpeg -i scene1.mp4 -ss 00:00:07.900 -vframes 1 scene1_ending.jpg
```

**Step 3: Generate Continuation (85% Same)**
```json
{
  "scene": "Scene 2 - Continuation",
  "starting_image": "scene1_ending.png",
  "prompt": "45-year-old father with salt-and-pepper hair finding water bottle 
  among emergency supplies in dimly lit garage, relieved expression, wearing 
  gray t-shirt, cinematic lighting with 2:1 ratio, handheld camera, shallow 
  depth of field"
}
```

**Notice**: Only changed "checking" ‚Üí "finding water bottle" and "worried" ‚Üí "relieved"

### Scene Segmentation Strategy

**Break Your Story into 8-Second Chunks**:
```
0:00-0:08  Scene 1a: Establish crisis/problem
0:08-0:16  Scene 1b: Continue - character reacts
0:16-0:24  Scene 2a: Introduce solution/product
0:24-0:32  Scene 2b: Continue - demonstrate solution
0:32-0:40  Scene 3a: Show transformation/results
0:40-0:48  Scene 3b: Continue - final impact
```

### Transition Management

**Expect 1-2 Second Potential Jump**:
- Trim awkward transition frames
- Add subtle crossfade if needed (0.5s)

**Pro Tip**: Ensure ending frames show clean, usable poses

### When to Start Fresh vs Continue

**Use Frame Continuation When**:
- ‚úÖ Same character in same location
- ‚úÖ Sequential action/story beat
- ‚úÖ Maintaining emotional continuity
- ‚úÖ Same time of day/lighting

**Start Fresh When**:
- ‚ùå Location change (garage ‚Üí kitchen)
- ‚ùå Time jump (day ‚Üí night)
- ‚ùå Different character/angle needed
- ‚ùå Major scene transition

## Critical Success Principles {#critical-success-principles}

### üéØ The Golden Rules

**1. Never Use Simple Prompts**
- ‚ùå "knight riding horse"
- ‚úÖ "silver armored knight on black horse riding through misty forest at dawn, cinematic wide shot with dramatic lighting"

**2. Always Include Negative Instructions**
- Essential phrase: "No subtitles, no distortions, no unrealistic proportions, no flickering, no extra characters"
- Prevents 80% of common failures

**3. Specify Everything**
- Time of day (golden hour, sunset, midnight)
- Camera movement (dolly in, pan right, tracking shot)
- Lighting style (soft natural light, dramatic shadows, neon glow)
- Audio cues (spoken dialogue, ambient sounds, music)

**4. Write Continuous Paragraphs**
- VEO 3 processes flowing narrative better than bullet points
- Avoid labeled sections in final prompt

**5. Think Like a Director, Not a Typist**
- You have film director power through prompts
- Provide complete production briefs, not casual descriptions
- **If it's not the model‚Äîit's your prompt**

## Vertical Video Mastery {#vertical-video-mastery}

### True 9:16 Video Creation with Kie.ai

**The Reality**: VEO 3 outputs 16:9 by default (even with vertical prompts)

**Solution**: Create vertically-framed content within 16:9, then crop in editing

### The Working Formula for 9:16 Content

```
A close-up vertically framed portrait video of [SUBJECT] standing in the 
center of the frame, captured in vertical mode, cinematic lighting, sharp 
focus, shallow depth of field, 9:16 aspect ratio. [SUBJECT ACTION]. 
Optimized for [PLATFORM] with [ENERGY LEVEL] energy and mobile-optimized 
composition.
```

### Platform-Specific Optimizations

**TikTok**:
- High energy, dynamic movement
- "Trending viral style with engaging visuals"
- Centered composition with clear subject
- Hook in first 2 seconds

**Instagram Reels**:
- Polished aesthetic, premium feel
- "Instagram-worthy framing with visual appeal"
- Smooth progression throughout
- Style-conscious composition

**YouTube Shorts**:
- Clear narrative, informative
- "Educational-friendly with good readability"
- Balanced energy, clear visual hierarchy
- Tutorial-friendly framing

**Snapchat**:
- Casual, authentic, fun
- Close-up focused for intimacy
- Immediate impact
- Spontaneous feel

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Post-Production Reality
- Generate with vertically-framed content centered in 16:9
- Check subject is centered and tight before cropping
- Crop to 9:16 in editing software

## Character Consistency {#character-consistency}

### The Professional Method: Custom AI Models

**For projects requiring perfect character consistency across 20+ scenes**

**Step 1: Create Character Dataset**
1. Start with one high-quality character image
2. Use VEO 3 "Frames to Video" with prompt: "turns and looks around"
3. Extract 10+ screenshots using Frame Extractor
4. Save multiple angles: front, side, 3/4 view

**Step 2: Train Custom Model (OpenArt)**
1. Upload dataset to OpenArt Characters feature
2. Name your character (e.g., "Marcus")
3. Train model (~10 minutes)
4. Generate unlimited consistent images

**Step 3: Generate Videos with Consistency**
- Use custom model images as video starting frames
- Keep character description identical across all prompts
- Structure: `[CONSISTENT CHARACTER DESC] + [NEW ACTION] + [NEW BACKGROUND]`

**Step 4: Voice Consistency (11 Labs)**
- Export audio from VEO 3 videos
- Use 11 Labs Voice Changer for consistent character voice
- Replace inconsistent VEO 3 audio with unified voice

### Quick Character Consistency (No Training)

**Claude Character Split Method**:
1. Generate full scene prompt
2. Ask Claude: "Split the prompt into character and action"
3. Result: Reusable character description + variable actions
4. Use same character desc for all scenes, change only actions

### Character Consistency Template

**Create once, copy exactly into every scene**:

```
MALE PROTAGONIST TEMPLATE:
- Male, mid-30s
- Shoulder-length brown hair with natural highlights
- Full beard (not just stubble)
- Lean athletic build
- Weathered/rugged appearance
- Olive green tactical jacket with chest pockets
- Dark tactical pants
- Black boots
- Survival gear (backpack, tools)
```

**Critical**: Never deviate from core details across scenes!

## Photorealistic Character Creation {#photorealistic-characters}

### The Imperfection Principle

**Critical Rule**: AI defaults to unrealistic perfection. True realism requires **intentional imperfections**.

‚ùå **What AI Defaults To**: Ultra-realistic texture overload, perfect skin, flawless hair
‚úÖ **What Looks Real**: Scars, pores, stray hairs, uneven skin tone, natural asymmetry

### Essential Character Details

**Use Claude Code Bot with this structure**:
```
I need a detailed character description for VEO 3. Ask me questions about:
1. Age, gender, ethnicity, facial features, body type
2. Skin imperfections: pores, sweat, oil, dirt, marks, cuts, scars, acne
3. Eye details: color, tints, eyelid position, wrinkles, crow's feet
4. Mouth/lips: condition, dryness, texture, natural asymmetry
5. Hair: thin/thick, color, cleanliness, messiness, stray strands
6. Emotional tone and facial expression
7. Clothing: texture, material, style, wear patterns, imperfections
8. Defining human traits that make them unique

Then provide a comprehensive VEO 3 prompt paragraph.
```

### Critical Focus Areas (Where Humans Look)

**1. Eyes (Primary Human Focus)**
- Specify: color, subtle tints, eyelid positions
- Include: surrounding wrinkles, crow's feet, under-eye texture
- Rule: "If an eye looks off, the entire image feels off"

**2. Mouth & Lips (Dialogue Authenticity)**
- Detail: lip condition, dryness, texture, natural asymmetry
- Critical during: any scene with dialogue or speaking
- Rule: Viewers watch mouths during dialogue to verify authenticity

**3. Skin Texture (Realism Foundation)**
- Always include: visible pores, sweat, oil, dirt
- Add imperfections: marks, cuts, uneven tone
- Avoid: AI's default "perfect skin" which looks fake

**4. Hair (The Detail Differentiator)**
- Specify: thin/thick quality, exact color, messiness level
- Always add: stray strands even in "clean" hairstyles
- Prevents: AI's polished, unrealistic hair defaults

### Advanced Lighting for Realism

**Lighting Specification Structure**:
```
[Natural/Artificial] + [Quality: hard/soft] + [Direction] + 
[Shadow type] + [Motivation] + [Exposure ratio]
```

**Exposure Ratios for Cinematic Look**:
- **2:1 or 4:1**: Soft contrast, professional look (RECOMMENDED)
- **1:1**: Flat lighting, no shadows (avoid)
- **32:1**: Harsh contrast, dramatic shadows (use sparingly)

**Example**:
```
"Soft natural lighting from window left, creating 2:1 exposure ratio with 
gentle shadows, motivated by golden hour sun"
```

### Atmospheric Realism Elements

**Add Light Interaction Physics**:
- Dust particles in light beams
- Atmospheric haze or mist
- Heat wave distortion (outdoor scenes)
- Volumetric god rays through windows

**Why It Works**: Shows how light interacts with environment, adding depth and authenticity

### Camera Technical Specifications

**Frame Rate & Settings**:
- Shutter speed: "1/50 for natural motion blur"
- ISO: "ISO 800 for slight grain" (adds texture)
- Depth of field: "Shallow DOF at F2.8" or "Deep focus at F16"

**Lens Character**:
- Vintage lenses: "Vintage Helios lens character"
- Telephoto: "85mm telephoto compression"
- Anamorphic: "Anamorphic lens flares and bokeh"
- Mobile aesthetic: "iPhone 15 Pro Max handheld footage"

**Aperture Guide**:
- **F1.4**: Maximum bokeh, extreme blur
- **F2.8-F4**: Balanced cinematic look (RECOMMENDED)
- **F8-F11**: Sharp environmental detail
- **F16-F22**: Everything in focus (landscapes)

### Color Palette Control (60-30-10 Rule)

**Professional Color Distribution**:
- **60%**: Dominant color (background, main environment)
- **30%**: Secondary color (supporting elements)
- **10%**: Accent pops (highlights, key details)

**Example**:
```
"Color palette: 60% muted blue-gray tones, 30% warm amber lighting, 
10% vibrant red accent on subject's jacket"
```

## Commercial-Quality JSON Prompting {#json-prompting}

### Why JSON Prompting Works

**The Core Principle**: JSON transforms vague ideas into precise production briefs.

‚ùå **What Most People Do**: "A forest at sunset" (hoping for cinematic results)
‚úÖ **What Professionals Do**: Complete production specification with exact technical details

**The Reality**:
- Most AI video failures come from **inadequate prompting**, not AI limitations
- VEO 3 understands camera movement, lighting, sound design, and storytelling
- **If you're getting mid results, it's your prompt, not the model**

### JSON = Production Brief

**Think Like a Director**:
- You're not describing a video‚Äîyou're **designing an experience**
- JSON provides the complete production brief a film crew would need
- Specificity = The difference between amateur and professional results

**What JSON Controls**:
- Lighting style and motivation
- Camera angles, movements, speeds
- Scene composition and framing
- Motion details and timing
- Audio textures and ambience
- Emotional tone and atmosphere
- Product/subject presentation details

### Master JSON Template

```json
{
  "description": "[One-sentence scene summary with key transformation]",
  "style": "[Specific aesthetic - 'Apple minimalist' not 'modern']",
  "camera": {
    "movement": "[Specific action with speed]",
    "angles": ["[Angle 1 with emotional purpose]", "[Angle 2]"],
    "lens": "[Lens type - '85mm macro' not 'close-up']"
  },
  "lighting": {
    "quality": "[Hard/soft with direction]",
    "mood": "[Emotional result of lighting]",
    "ratio": "[2:1 or 4:1 exposure ratio]"

- Example: "Low angle shot looking up at subject, conveying strength"

**High Angles** (Camera looking down):
- Suggests: Vulnerability, weakness, insignificance
- Use for: Defeated moments, showing scale, isolation
- Example: "High angle looking down, emphasizing smallness"

**Eye-Level Angles**:
- Suggests: Equality, neutrality, documentary realism
- Use for: Conversations, relatable moments, natural scenes
- Example: "Eye-level shot creating intimate connection"

**Dutch Angles** (Tilted):
- Suggests: Unease, chaos, disorientation
- Use for: Tension, psychological distress, action
- Example: "Dutch angle with 15-degree tilt creating tension"

### Compositional Techniques

**Rule of Thirds**:
- Place subject on intersection points
- "Subject positioned on right third line, balanced composition"

**Centered Symmetry** (Wes Anderson Style):
- Perfect center framing with symmetrical elements
- "Wes Anderson-style centered symmetrical composition"

**Leading Lines**:
- Use environmental elements to guide eye
- "Leading lines from road converging toward subject"

## Troubleshooting Guide {#troubleshooting}

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Character appearance changes between scenes
**Cause**: Inconsistent character description across prompts
**Solution**:
- Create master character template
- Copy EXACT description into every scene
- Never paraphrase or "improve" details
- Use distinctive features as anchors
- **CRITICAL**: Ensure ending frames show character's face clearly

**Issue**: Character consistency broken in continuation
**Cause**: Previous ending frame didn't show face
**Solution**:
- Always end scenes with face visible (3/4 profile minimum)
- Plan ahead: If character turns away, ensure they turn back
- Include in prompt: "ending with character's face visible"
- Check ending frame before moving to next scene

**Issue**: Actions feel rushed or incomplete
**Cause**: Too much action crammed into 8 seconds
**Solution**:
- Focus on ONE clear action per scene
- Use "At X seconds" timestamps
- Max 4 distinct 2-second steps serving one action
- Add additional scenes if needed for pacing

**Issue**: Scene N+1 doesn't match Scene N ending
**Cause**: Prompt doesn't accurately describe ending frame state
**Solution**:
- Review ending frame carefully before writing next prompt
- Copy exact pose/position description
- Ensure lighting description matches
- Use image-to-video with uploaded frame

**Issue**: Lighting jumps dramatically between scenes
**Cause**: Unrealistic lighting progression
**Solution**:
- Plan natural time progression upfront
- Use transition scenes for major changes
- Keep lighting direction consistent
- Establish environmental aesthetics at transition point

**Issue**: Props/products don't match real branding
**Cause**: AI invents generic versions
**Solution**:
- Keep product visible throughout all scenes
- Plan for post-production compositing
- Generate with generic descriptions
- Replace AI products with real photography

**Issue**: Environmental elements disappear (trees, buildings)
**Cause**: Not explicitly stated to remain constant
**Solution**:
- State what must remain: "oak tree remains visible throughout"
- Specify changes affect appearance, not existence
- Use fixed camera positions for consistency
- Repeat key elements at each time point

## Quick Reference Checklist

### Before Generating:
- [ ] Prompt includes all 10 components
- [ ] Negative instructions included
- [ ] Character imperfections specified (pores, stray hair, skin texture)
- [ ] Lighting exposure ratio defined (2:1 or 4:1 recommended)
- [ ] Atmospheric elements added (dust, haze, mist)
- [ ] Camera angle chosen for story meaning
- [ ] Lens character specified
- [ ] Aperture setting included (F2.8-F4 for cinematic)
- [ ] Color palette follows 60-30-10 rule
- [ ] Time of day specified
- [ ] Camera movement detailed
- [ ] Audio description added
- [ ] Continuous paragraph format (no bullets)

### For Multi-Scene Projects:
- [ ] Story broken into 8-second beats
- [ ] One action per scene identified
- [ ] Character consistency template created
- [ ] Ending frames planned with face visible
- [ ] Scene 1 establishes all character/environment details
- [ ] Transition scenes planned for major changes
- [ ] Product visibility maintained throughout
- [ ] Environmental transition descriptions written
- [ ] Lighting progression mapped naturally

### Settings:
- [ ] Resolution: Highest available
- [ ] Mode: Fast for tests, Quality for finals
- [ ] Audio: Enabled (if needed)
- [ ] Aspect ratio: Match intended platform
- [ ] First frame: Upload previous ending frame (if continuation)

### After Generation:
- [ ] Upscale to 4K using OpenArt
- [ ] Extract last frame for next scene
- [ ] Verify character face visible in ending frame
- [ ] Check continuity with previous scene
- [ ] Replace audio with 11 Labs (if needed for character voice)
- [ ] Add film grain (disguises AI origins)
- [ ] Add chromatic aberration (lens imperfection)
- [ ] Trim transition jumps (if needed)
- [ ] Crop/adjust for vertical (if social media)
- [ ] Save successful prompts for reuse

## The Bottom Line

**Success Formula = Detailed Prompts + Intentional Imperfections + Frame Continuity + Always Upscale**

### Core Principles Summary:

1. **Use Claude template** for automatic prompt optimization (general content)
2. **Use JSON prompting** for commercial/professional work (precise control)
3. **Add intentional imperfections** (AI defaults to fake perfection)
4. **Specify exposure ratios** (2:1 or 4:1 for cinematic look)
5. **Include atmospheric elements** (dust, haze, light interaction)
6. **Define camera angles** for story meaning
7. **Never skip negative instructions**
8. **Test with veo3_fast** before veo3
9. **Always upscale to 4K**
10. **Plan frame-to-frame continuity** for long videos

### When to Use Which Method:

**üìù Paragraph Prompts (Claude Template)**:
- Social media content
- Personal projects
- Quick generations
- Simple scenes
- 90% of your use cases

**üìä JSON Prompts (Structured)**:
- Commercial/advertising content
- Brand campaigns
- Client deliverables
- Product showcases
- Precise control requirements

**üé¨ Frame-to-Frame Workflow**:
- Long-form content (30+ seconds)
- Narrative storytelling
- Character-driven scenes
- Sequential action sequences
- Professional seamless flow

### Remember:

**"We don't want it perfect. We want it real."**

True photorealism comes from intentional imperfections. Focus on eyes, mouths, skin texture, and hair‚Äîthese are where humans detect artificial content.

**For Longer Videos**: Use frame-to-frame continuation. Extract last frame with face clearly visible. Use as starting image for next scene with 85% identical prompt.

**VEO 3 Maximum**: 8 seconds per clip (cannot be extended). Plan accordingly.
