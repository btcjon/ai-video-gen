## 3. COMPLETE 40-SECOND TIKTOK SCRIPT

```
[0-3s] HOOK:
"I didn't realize how dangerous camping water was until my daughter got E. coli from a 'clear' stream."

[3-10s] PERSONAL INTRO + PROBLEM:
"I'm a mom who loves hiking with my kids, and I thought if water looked clean, it was fine. Wrong. That trip to urgent care taught meâ€”bacteria you can't see can seriously hurt you."

[10-18s] AMPLIFY PROBLEM:
"I tried those pump filtersâ€”they clog. Boiling takes forever and needs fuel. Chemical tablets taste disgusting and don't even kill everything. I needed something that actually works without the hassle."

[18-25s] PRODUCT INTRODUCTION:
"That's when I found H2O Pure. It's this tiny 6ml bottle that fits in your pocketâ€”8 drops per gallon, wait an hour, and it destroys E. coli, salmonella, all the nasty stuff that makes you sick."

[25-33s] EXPERIENCE & DIFFERENTIATION:
"It's 99% natural copper and zinc mineralsâ€”lab-proven to eliminate bacteria, not just 'reduce' it. No weird taste, no moving parts to break, and one bottle treats 15+ gallons. It's literally 3 cents per gallon."

[33-40s] SOCIAL PROOF + CTA:
"I keep one in my car, one in my hiking pack, one at home. Made in USA, 30-day guarantee. Link in bioâ€”use code PURE20. Your family's safety is worth it."

Total Length: 40 seconds
```

## 4. VISUAL DIRECTION NOTES

### VISUAL STRATEGY:

**[0-3s] Hook:**
- Open with worried/stressed face to camera OR medical bracelet/urgent care wristband close-up
- Quick cut to clear stream footage (looks innocent)

**[3-10s] Personal Intro:**
- Genuine concern while holding H2O Pure bottle
- B-roll: Family hiking photos, kids playing near stream

**[10-18s] Problem Amplification:**
- Quick cuts showing frustration:
  * Bulky pump filter (heavy, cumbersome)
  * Boiling water on camp stove (time-consuming)
  * Chemical tablet dropped in water (unappetizing)

**[18-25s] Product Introduction:**
- Hand holding H2O Pure bottle next to quarter for size comparison
- Demonstrate 8 drops into water bottle/gallon jug
- Timer overlay showing "Wait 1 hour"

**[25-33s] Benefits/Differentiation:**
- Split screen: H2O Pure vs bulky alternatives
- Text overlay: "99% NATURAL | LAB-PROVEN | 3Â¢/GALLON"
- Pour treated water into clear glass (clean, appetizing)

**[33-40s] CTA:**
- Show 3 H2O Pure bottles in different locations (car glove box, backpack pocket, kitchen drawer)
- Final frame: Product + code "PURE20" + link in bio prompt

### ESSENTIAL B-ROLL SHOTS:
- Clear mountain stream (deceptively beautiful)
- Family camping/hiking scenes
- Frustrated expressions with bulky water filters
- H2O Pure bottle in palm of hand (size emphasis)
- Dropping 8 drops into gallon jug
- Pouring crystal-clear treated water
- Multiple bottles in emergency kit/car/backpack
- Kids drinking safely from treated water

### EDITING NOTES:
- **Pacing:** Fast cuts during problem section (10-18s), slow down for product demo (18-33s)
- **Text overlays:**
  * "E. COLI FROM 'CLEAN' WATER" (3s)
  * "99% NATURAL MINERALS" (26s)
  * "15+ GALLONS PER BOTTLE" (28s)
  * "3Â¢ PER GALLON" (30s)
  * "CODE: PURE20" (37s)
- **Music:** Start anxious/tense (0-18s), shift to hopeful/confident (18-40s)
- **Transitions:** Use hard cuts for urgency, smooth dissolves for product benefits

## 6. OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### TEST VARIATIONS:

**Hook A/B Test Options:**
- Test Hook 1 (personal story) vs Hook 2 (preparedness urgency) vs Hook 7 (shocking fact)
- Personal story may perform best with parents; urgency with preppers; fact with skeptics

**Length Variations:**
- 40s version (as scripted above)
- 25s version: Cut problem amplification section, go straight from intro to product
- 60s version: Add objection handling ("I thought it was expensive until I did the mathâ€”3Â¢/gallon vs $3/bottle")

**CTA Variations:**
- Version A: "Link in bioâ€”use code PURE20"
- Version B: "Comment 'SAFE' for the link and 20% off code"
- Version C: "Tap the yellow link. Code PURE20 saves you 20%"

### SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK:

**Primary Metrics:**
- Hook rate (% watching past 3s): Target 55%+ (fear-based hooks perform well)
- Hold rate (% watching to CTA at 33s): Target 35%+
- CTR (click-through rate): Target 8-12% (safety/family content drives action)
- Conversion rate: Target 3-6%

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Save rate: Target 6%+ (preparedness content gets saved for later)
- Share rate: Target 4%+ (parents share safety tips)
- Comment engagement: Look for questions about usage, skepticism about effectiveness

**Optimization Strategy:**
1. If hook rate <45%: Test more shocking/emotional hooks
2. If hold drops at 18-25s: Product intro too slowâ€”speed up demo
3. If CTR <5%: Strengthen urgency in CTA or add limited-time offer
4. If comments show price objection: Add "3Â¢/gallon" text overlay earlier (15s)

### Trust Builders:
5. Show product packaging clearly (establishes it's real)
6. Include "Made in USA" and "Lab-Proven" text overlays
7. Mention 30-day guarantee to reduce purchase risk
8. Use steady hands during demo (conveys confidence)

### Conversion Boosters:
9. Repeat CTA twice: once at 33s, reinforce at 38s
10. Make discount code memorable and valuable (PURE20 = 20% off)
11. Create urgency without being salesy ("Your family's safety is worth it")
12. End with strong eye contact and slight nod (confidence signal)
