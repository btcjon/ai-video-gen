At 0-2 seconds: Woman maintains eye contact with camera, holding bottle prominently at upper chest level in right hand, warm smile beginning to fade into concerned expression, left hand relaxed at side, natural selfie framing, bottle clearly visible and well-lit.

At 2-4 seconds: RIGHT HAND STAYS RAISED holding bottle at same upper chest position, expression shifts to genuine maternal concern while recalling daughter's illness, slight camera reframe (natural selfie movement), eyebrows furrow slightly, bottle remains anchored in center-left frame area between face and camera, THE BOTTLE NEVER LEAVES HER RIGHT HAND.

At 4-6 seconds: RIGHT HAND STILL HOLDING BOTTLE at upper chest level in clear view, face shows authentic worry transitioning to determination, another subtle camera adjustment (handheld selfie style), stray hair strands move naturally with head movement, BOTTLE STAYS LOCKED AT UPPER CHEST LEVEL, lighting consistent on both face and product.

At 6-8 seconds: FINAL FRAME - Right hand firmly gripping H2O Pure bottle at upper chest level, bottle clearly visible and well-lit in center-left frame positioned between face and camera, face in 3/4 profile showing shift from concern to confident discovery, warm smile beginning to return, authentic maternal strength in expression, THE BOTTLE MUST BE CLEARLY VISIBLE IN THIS FINAL FRAME for Scene 2 continuity.

Setting: Indoor home environment with soft window light from left creating 2:1 exposure ratio, warm natural wood tones in soft focus background suggesting cozy family home, authentic lived-in aesthetic with subtle home details (plant silhouette, neutral wall), intimate documentary style.

Camera: Handheld selfie style with natural movement, 50mm equivalent lens at F2.8 creating gentle background blur, eye-level intimate connection, subtle repositioning throughout maintaining product visibility, authentic UGC aesthetic not overly polished.

Lighting: Soft natural window light from camera left at 45-degree angle creating 2:1 exposure ratio with gentle fill from room bounce, warm color temperature (3800K) suggesting afternoon home setting, natural skin tones with slight glow from window light, no harsh shadows, atmospheric dust particles barely visible in light beam adding depth.

Color Palette: 60% warm neutral home tones (cream walls, natural wood, warm fleece green), 30% soft skin tones and hair highlights catching light, 10% H2O Pure bottle white and blue providing product accent pop in frame.

Audio: Authentic concerned maternal voice speaking naturally about daughter's E. coli experience, slight vocal stress on "dangerous" and "clear stream", ambient quiet home environment, no background music, natural breath sounds, intimate confession tone, no subtitles.

Style: Authentic TikTok UGC aesthetic, raw and relatable not overly produced, Instagram influencer mom documentary style, genuine emotion not performance, handheld intimate feel, photorealistic with natural imperfections.

Emotional Tone: Viewers should feel immediate maternal concern and fear, relatability to family safety anxiety, emotional hook that stops scroll through genuine vulnerability and shocking personal story.

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: H2O Pure bottle never leaves woman's right hand. Right hand stays raised at upper chest level for all 8 seconds. Bottle must be visible in every single frame from 0-8 seconds, positioned between her face and camera in center-left frame area. If the bottle disappears from frame at any point, the generation has failed. The product is the co-star with her face - equal importance for brand visibility and frame-to-frame continuity.
