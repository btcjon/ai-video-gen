## Audio Integration

### Dialogue Format

**Single:**
```
Character: "Words."
```

**Multiple:**
```
Explorer: "We're losing daylight."
Companion: "Not until we cross the river."
```

**With Delivery:**
```
Warrior (quietly): "They're closer than we thought."
```

**Silent:**
```
"no dialogue" or "actors not speaking"
```

### Ambient Examples

**Natural:**
```
[Audio: breeze, bird calls, rustling leaves]
[Audio: ocean waves, seagulls, wind]
[Audio: rain on windows, thunder, wind chimes]
```

**Urban:**
```
[Audio: traffic, footsteps echoing, sirens]
[Audio: café ambience, coffee machines, conversations]
[Audio: subway rumble, announcements, crowd murmur]
```

**Interior:**
```
[Audio: fireplace crackling, pages turning, clock ticking]
[Audio: keyboard typing, office phones, AC hum]
```

**Action:**
```
[Audio: heavy rain, thunder, footsteps splashing]
[Audio: tires screeching, engine roaring, glass shattering]
```

### Layering Strategy

- **Primary:** Main environmental (rain, wind, ocean)
- **Secondary:** Action/movement (footsteps, machinery)
- **Tertiary:** Subtle atmosphere (distant voices, hum)
- **Dialogue:** Speaker attribution + delivery notes

---

## Technical Settings

**Resolution:**
- 480p - Quick previews
- 720p - Testing (recommended)
- 1080p - Final outputs

**Duration:**
- 5s - Action, dialogue-heavy
- 10s - Establishing shots, atmospheric

**Aspect Ratios:**
- 16:9 - YouTube, landscape, cinematic
- 9:16 - TikTok, Instagram Reels, vertical
- 1:1 - Instagram feed, square

**Modes:**
- Fast - Quicker generation, drafts
- Standard - Higher quality, finals

---

## Visual Styles

- **Photorealistic** - Ultra-realistic
- **Cinematic** - Film-like, dramatic
- **Anime** - Japanese animation, vibrant
- **VHS Retro** - Vintage 80s/90s analog
- **Film Noir** - High contrast B&W, dramatic shadows
- **Abstract** - Artistic, non-representational
- **Documentary** - Natural, realistic
- **Commercial** - Polished, professional

---

## Pro Tips

**1. Test in 720p** - Iterate in 720p/Fast, finalize in 1080p/Standard

**2. Duration Strategy** - 5s for dialogue/action, 10s for establishing/atmospheric

**3. Dialogue Best Practices:**
- Use quote marks: "Speech"
- Include speaker ID
- Add delivery notes (whispering, shouting)
- Frontal angles for better lip-sync
- Slow character motion during dialogue

**4. Audio Sync** - Layer ambient/foreground/background, match intensity to visuals

**5. Camera Selection:**
- Static - Dialogue, emotion
- Handheld - Realism, documentary
- Dolly/Pan - Professional cinematic
- FPV Drone - Dynamic aerial
- Crane - Dramatic reveals

**6. Precision:**
- Specific: "warm golden hour" vs "good lighting"
- Active verbs: "dancing energetically" vs "moving"
- Sensory details: "rain pattering," "wind howling"
- Balance detail - too much confuses AI

**7. Negative Prompts:**
```
"Blurry, distorted, low quality, flickering, watermark, text overlay"
```

**8. Reference Images** - Upload for coherence, use Midjourney/DALL-E for character refs

**9. Iteration** - Start simple, add complexity gradually, test low-res, refine

**10. Integration** - Combine with Midjourney v7, Promptus, ComfyUI

## Common Mistakes

❌ Too much action in 5-10s - Keep focused
❌ Vague audio - Be specific
❌ No camera direction - Always specify
❌ No mood/style - Define aesthetic
❌ Unclear dialogue attribution
❌ Overly complex prompts
❌ Ignoring lighting
❌ No negative prompts
❌ Rapid language switches
❌ Excessive camera movements

---

## Troubleshooting

**Characters speaking when you want silence:**
Add `"no dialogue"` or `"actors not speaking"`

**Lip-sync inaccurate:**
- Frontal camera angles
- Slow character motion during dialogue
- Clear, simple dialogue
- Shorter sentences
- Upload voice tracks

**Character appearance changes:**
- Reduce to 5s
- More specific details
- Simplify background/motion
- Consistent lighting
- Use reference images

**Jittery/unstable motion:**
- Gentler camera movements
- Reduce background complexity
- Single light sources
- Simplify composition

**Inconsistent results:**
- Simplify prompts
- Avoid complex temporal sequences
- Use start/end frames
- Generate variations
- Test negative prompts

**Audio not matching visuals:**
- Describe audio specifically
- Match intensity to action
- Layer sounds logically
- Use [Audio: ...] format

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Shot Storytelling
1. Establishing Shot (10s) - Scene/location
2. Character Intro (5s) - Protagonist
3. Action/Dialogue (5s) - Key moment
4. Reaction/Resolution (5s) - Payoff

### Continuity
- Consistent lighting across shots
- Identical character details
- Match camera style/movement
- Maintain mood/tone
- Reference images for consistency

### Audio Layering
**Layer 1 - Primary:** `[Audio: heavy rain]`
**Layer 2 - Secondary:** `[Audio: footsteps splashing]`
**Layer 3 - Tertiary:** `[Audio: distant sirens, thunder]`
**Layer 4 - Dialogue:** `Detective (breathlessly): "Stop!"`

### Camera Combinations
```
"Camera dolly in, transitions to crane up revealing scene, ends with slow orbit"
```

### VFX Integration
```
"Explosion VFX as car crashes, debris flying, slow-motion bullet time as character dives"
```

### Style Mashups
```
"Blade Runner cyberpunk + anime visual style, neon-drenched with hand-drawn quality"
```
