- **Related Concepts**: Cinematic intention, emotional direction, visual storytelling

## Procedures & Techniques

### 7-Point Prompt Formula (Complete Structure)

**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive control over every aspect of a Veo 3 generated shot

**Components**:
1. **Subject**: "Who's in the scene?"
2. **Action**: "what are they doing?"
3. **Setting**: "where is this happening?"
4. **Camera**: "how should it be filmed?"
5. **Lighting/Mood**: "what's the atmosphere like?"
6. **Audio/Dialogue**: "what do we hear or what's being said?"
7. **Visual Style**: "What should it feel like visually?"

**Complete Example**:
"A panda warrior stands on a snowy mountain holding a glowing spear. The camera slowly zooms in from below. The morning light glows behind him. Audio windb blowing. He says, 'This is my path.' Visual style cinematic ultra realistic 4K texture. Shallow depth of field."

**Core Principle**: "the more clearly you describe what you want, the more control you have over the result. That's not just a tip. It's the entire game"

**Prerequisites**: Understanding of cinematography terminology, clear vision of desired shot

**Expected Outcome**: Precise, controlled video generation matching directorial intent

### Fixing Vague Prompts

**Problem**: Being too vague

**Bad Example**: "A character walking in the city"
- **Why It Fails**: "That's not enough. What kind of character? What city? What time of day? What's the vibe?"

**Good Example**: "A teenage robot in a neon lit Tokyo alley walking nervously. Rain falls. Camera follows from behind. Visual style. Cyberpunk anime"

**Key Additions**:
- Specific character type (teenage robot)
- Specific location (neon-lit Tokyo alley)
- Specific movement quality (walking nervously)
- Environmental detail (rain)
- Camera instruction (follows from behind)
- Visual style (Cyberpunk anime)

### Adding Camera and Style

**Problem**: "forgetting camera or style"

**Why It Matters**: "VO is a video tool, not a slideshow generator. If you don't include camera movement, it might default to a static flat shot. Same with style. If you don't define it, the look will feel generic"

**Fix**: "Always add something like camera slowly rotates around or in cinematic style with shallow depth of field"

**Purpose**: Prevent static, generic-looking outputs

### Simplifying Complex Prompts

**Problem**: "trying to do too much in one prompt"

**Warning**: "If you cram three characters, four actions, and two locations into one prompt, the AI gets confused"

**Fix**: "Think in shots, not scenes. One prompt, it will one clear visual moment"

**Rule of Thumb**: "If your prompt feels like a short story, it's probably too much"

**Principle**: "Keep it visual, keep it simple, and let each scene breathe"

### Breaking the 8-Second Limit (Multi-Shot Workflow)

**Purpose**: Create longer videos by planning sequences of connected shots

**Step 1 - Think in Scenes, Not Videos**:
- "Don't try to make a 30-secondond movie in one prompt"
- Break down structure: "Intro shot, action shot, reaction shot, ending moment"
- Formula: "one scene, Exel, one VO prompt. Link them later in editing"

**Step 2 - Maintain Continuity Between Prompts**:
- "Use the same character, environment, and style across all clips"

**Example Sequence**:
- "Scene one, a panda ninja stands on a rooftop. Night cinematic"
- "Scene two, same panda ninja jumps to the next rooftop. Moonlight in the background"
- "Scene three, close-up of the panda's face breathing heavily. Camera shakes slightly"

**Result**: "This makes your story feel connected, even if it's built from separate clips"

**Step 3 - Editing**:
- "Once you've got three, four short clips, use simple tools like Cap Cut, Canva, Premiier Rush, or even Tik Tok editor"
- Actions: "add sound transitions, sync music, keep the pacing tight, add text or dialogue"

**Bonus Workflow**: "always write your script before you write your prompts. That's how pro filmmakers use Veo. They don't just generate cool shots, they plan a story shot by shot, and they treat Veo like their virtual film crew"

**Advanced Tool**: "if you're trying to build a full short film with tight continuity across scenes, use Google Flow. It's designed to help you storyboard, manage your prompts, and keep your whole video project organized, like a real production pipeline"

**Prerequisites**: Script planning, understanding of film editing, access to editing tools

**Expected Outcome**: Coherent multi-shot videos exceeding 8-second limit

### Hero Shot Formula

**Purpose**: "for short, powerful moments. Perfect for Tik Toks, trailers, intros, or dramatic reveals"

**Formula Structure**:
"character + bold action + slow camera move + emotional lighting + signature dialogue"

**Complete Example**:
"A girl in a red hoodie stands on a rooftop, lightning flashing behind her. Camera slowly circles around. She looks into the lens and says, 'I'm done hiding.' Visual style, cinematic, dramatic shadows, rain falling"

**Why It Works**: "You give Veo just enough to build a visually iconic moment instantly"

**Use Cases**:
- TikToks
- Trailers
- Intros
- Dramatic reveals

### Scene Sandwich Formula

**Purpose**: "for building longer stories"

**Structure**: "scene setup, key moment, emotional beat"

**Three-Prompt Example**:
1. "Prompt one, a boy runs into an empty stadium at sunset, out of breath, wide shot"
2. "Prompt two, close-up of his hands opening a worn journal. Wind blows. Text on screen. One more try"
3. "Prompt three. He walks onto the field alone. Camera follows from behind. Score rises"

**Why It Works**: "You build a story rhythm through shots, not just words"

**Prerequisites**: Understanding of story beats, emotional pacing

**Expected Outcome**: Emotionally resonant sequence with narrative progression

### Style-First Shot Formula

**Purpose**: "For strong visual identity"

**Approach**: "Start with visual direction first, then add subject and action"

**Formula Structure**:
"Visual style + camera + mood → THEN → character + action"

**Complete Example**:
"cinematic 4K ultra crisp shallow depth of field. Camera tilts up from the ground slowly. A violinist plays under a single spotlight on a dark stage"

**Why It Works**: "When you're aiming for visual aesthetic, leading with style can guide the entire shot move"

**Use Cases**: When visual aesthetic is primary concern, establishing signature look

### Directorial Questioning Framework

**Mental Shift**: "next time, don't just ask what to show. Ask, 'What should this moment feel like?'"

**Purpose**: Shift from descriptive to emotional/intentional prompting

**Related Philosophy**: "You're not just writing prompts, you're directing shots"

## Warnings & Pitfalls

### Mistake 1: Being Too Vague
- **Common Error**: "A character walking in the city"
- **Why It Fails**: Missing character type, specific location, time of day, atmosphere, movement quality, camera, style
- **Consequence**: Generic, unfocused output
- **Fix Required**: Add specificity across all 7 prompt components

### Mistake 2: Forgetting Camera or Style
- **Problem**: Omitting camera movement or visual style specifications
- **Why It Fails**: "If you don't include camera movement, it might default to a static flat shot. Same with style. If you don't define it, the look will feel generic"
- **Consequence**: Static, visually uninteresting results
- **Better Approach**: Always include camera directive and style specification

### Mistake 3: Overloading Prompts
- **Problem**: "trying to do too much in one prompt"
- **Example**: "three characters, four actions, and two locations into one prompt"
- **Why It Fails**: "the AI gets confused"
- **Warning Sign**: "If your prompt feels like a short story, it's probably too much"
- **Fix**: Break into multiple single-focus prompts

### Scene vs. Shot Confusion
- **Limitation**: "Veo is not a movie editor. It's a scene builder"
- **Constraint**: Each prompt should equal one clear visual moment
- **Context**: Understanding this prevents frustration and poor results
- **Better Approach**: Plan shot-by-shot, edit later

### Continuity Management Challenge
- **Issue**: No built-in character consistency across generations (implied)
- **Workaround**: "Use the same character, environment, and style across all clips"
- **Context**: Requires manual consistency management in prompt writing
- **Tool Solution**: Google Flow for organizing prompts and maintaining continuity

7. Visual Style: "cinematic ultra realistic 4K texture. Shallow depth of field"

**Lesson**: All 7 components present creates comprehensive control

### Example 2: Vague vs. Specific (Character in City)

**Bad Version**: "A character walking in the city"
- Missing: Character type, city specifics, time, atmosphere, movement quality, camera, style

**Good Version**: "A teenage robot in a neon lit Tokyo alley walking nervously. Rain falls. Camera follows from behind. Visual style. Cyberpunk anime"
- Added: Specific character (teenage robot), specific location (neon-lit Tokyo alley), movement quality (nervously), weather (rain), camera (follows from behind), style (Cyberpunk anime)

**Improvement**: Transforms generic concept into specific, controllable shot

### Example 3: Multi-Shot Panda Ninja Sequence

**Scene 1**: "a panda ninja stands on a rooftop. Night cinematic"
**Scene 2**: "same panda ninja jumps to the next rooftop. Moonlight in the background"
**Scene 3**: "close-up of the panda's face breathing heavily. Camera shakes slightly"

**Continuity Elements**:
- Same character: "panda ninja" → "same panda ninja"
- Same time: "Night" → "Moonlight"
- Progressive action: stands → jumps → breathing heavily
- Increasing intimacy: wide → medium → close-up

**Lesson**: Shows how to maintain continuity while varying shots

### Example 4: Hero Shot - Girl on Rooftop

**Formula Application**: character + bold action + slow camera move + emotional lighting + signature dialogue

**Complete Prompt**: "A girl in a red hoodie stands on a rooftop, lightning flashing behind her. Camera slowly circles around. She looks into the lens and says, 'I'm done hiding.' Visual style, cinematic, dramatic shadows, rain falling"

**Component Breakdown**:

- Establishes character, location, emotional state, framing

**Key Moment (Prompt 2)**: "close-up of his hands opening a worn journal. Wind blows. Text on screen. One more try"
- Reveals object of significance, adds environmental detail, adds text element

**Emotional Beat (Prompt 3)**: "He walks onto the field alone. Camera follows from behind. Score rises"
- Shows character decision, uses camera positioning for emotion, adds music cue

**Narrative Arc**: Exhaustion → Reflection → Determination

**Lesson**: Three shots create complete emotional story beat

### Example 6: Style-First Shot - Violinist

**Formula**: Visual style + camera + mood → character + action

**Complete Prompt**: "cinematic 4K ultra crisp shallow depth of field. Camera tilts up from the ground slowly. A violinist plays under a single spotlight on a dark stage"

**Structure**:
- Style leads: "cinematic 4K ultra crisp shallow depth of field"
- Camera specified: "tilts up from the ground slowly"
- Mood established: "single spotlight on a dark stage"
- Subject/action last: "A violinist plays"

**When to Use**: When visual aesthetic is the primary creative goal

## Full Transcript

I am Tyraminotaur, born from sweetness, forged by rage. In this video, I'll show you how to prompt like a director, not a beginner, not a guesser, a director. Stay till the end and you'll steal. Three prolevel prompt frameworks that work every single time. A sneaky way to break Veo's 8-second limit and the exact mindset pros use to turn AI into a cinematic weapon. Let's build real movies with zero gear, zero budget, and one deadly good sentence. Still cramming at 3:00 a.m., let me season your brain.

Before we get into how to write great prompts, let's clear one thing up. If you're going to learn an AI video tool, make sure it's actually worth your time. So, here's a simple sideby-side comparison of what the top AI video tools can and can't do right now. Let's start simple. Out of all the tools out there, only Veo 3 checks all the boxes. It creates audio, lets characters talk, delivers highquality visuals, and it's already in limited use by creators. Now, let's break that down a bit further. Here's what really sets Veo 3 apart and why no other tool currently offers this full package. Other tools are getting better, but Veo is the only one right now that feels like you're working with a real cinematographer. And the best part, all of it is controlled with one thing, your prompt.

Most AI video tools can generate decent visuals. Some even do motion pretty well. But here's the truth. Only V3 gives you full cinematic control inside a single prompt. Here's what only V3 can do right now. Real camera movement. You can literally say the camera dollies in from a low angle and it happens just like in a real movie. Emotion through physical detail. You describe tension in someone's jaw or wind moving their hair, and Veo translates that into motion. Not a guess, but real physics-based animation. Speech with synced lips. Write a line of dialogue in your prompt. The character will say it with lips matching perfectly. No dubbing, no voiceovers. Just type it and it speaks. Sound effects and atmosphere. Want thunder, rain, firecracking, or cinematic music? Add it in the prompt. Veo will build the audio environment for you, generated, not preloaded.

Now that you know why Veo is different, let's talk about the one thing that makes or breaks your results, your prompt. Writing for Veo isn't like chatting with Chat GPT. You're not just asking a question. You're giving directions. Think of it like you're describing a movie shot to someone who's never seen it, but has the power to create it instantly. So, the more clearly you describe what you want, the more control you have over what Veo gives back.

Let's look at a full example. A panda warrior stands on a snowy mountain holding a glowing spear. The camera slowly zooms in from below. The morning light glows behind him. Audio windb blowing. He says, "This is my path." Visual style cinematic ultra realistic 4K texture. Shallow depth of field. This is my path.

Here's the seven-point prompt formula I use every time. Subject: Who's in the scene? Action, what are they doing? Setting, where is this happening? Camera, how should it be filmed? Lighting, mood, what's the atmosphere like? Audio, dialogue, what do we hear or what's being said? Visual style. What should it feel like visually?

I'll say it one more time because this part really matters. The more clearly you describe what you want, the more control you have over the result. That's not just a tip. It's the entire game.

Now, just because you know the formula doesn't mean you'll get it right every time. Let's go over the common mistakes where most people go wrong with Veo and how to fix them fast.

Mistake number one, being too vague. Bad prompt. A character walking in the city. That's not enough. What kind of character? What city? What time of day? What's the vibe? Fix. A teenage robot in a neon lit Tokyo alley walking nervously. Rain falls. Camera follows from behind. Visual style. Cyberpunk anime.

Mistake number two, forgetting camera or style. VO is a video tool, not a slideshow generator. If you don't include camera movement, it might default to a static flat shot. Same with style. If you don't define it, the look will feel generic. Fix. Always add something like camera slowly rotates around or in cinematic style with shallow depth of field.

Mistake number three, trying to do too much in one prompt. Veo is not a movie editor. It's a scene builder. If you cram three characters, four actions, and two locations into one prompt, the AI gets confused. Fix. Think in shots, not scenes. One prompt, it will one clear visual moment. If your prompt feels like a short story, it's probably too much. Keep it visual, keep it simple, and let each scene breathe.

Up next, we'll take everything you've learned and show you how to go beyond 8 seconds using prolevel tips to build longer videos. Link scenes and tell full stories with Veo. Here's how to go beyond 8 seconds. The smart way.

Step one, think in scenes, not videos. Don't try to make a 30-secondond movie in one prompt. Instead, break it down. Intro shot, action shot, reaction shot, ending moment, one scene, Exel, one VO prompt. Link them later in editing.

Keep continuity between prompts. Use the same character, environment, and style across all clips. Example scene one, a panda ninja stands on a rooftop. Night cinematic. Scene two, same panda ninja jumps to the next rooftop. Moonlight in the background. Scene three, close-up of the panda's face breathing heavily. Camera shakes slightly. This makes your story feel connected, even if it's built from separate clips.

Step three, use editing tools to stitch it all together. Once you've got three, four short clips, use simple tools like Cap Cut, Canva, Premiier Rush, or even Tik Tok editor to add sound transitions, sync music, keep the pacing tight, add text or dialogue.

Bonus tip, always write your script before you write your prompts. That's how pro filmmakers use Veo. They don't just generate cool shots, they plan a story shot by shot, and they treat Veo like their virtual film crew.

And if you want to take it one step further, if you're trying to build a full short film with tight continuity across scenes, use Google Flow. It's designed to help you storyboard, manage your prompts, and keep your whole video project organized, like a real production pipeline. Want me to make a full walkthrough on how to use Google Flow with VO? Drop a comment below, and I'll cover it in the next video.

I'm done hiding. This is where things get serious. If you're just here to play around, that's fine. But if you want to create shots that feel like cinema that hit people emotionally, visually, viscerally, then you've got to think differently. VO isn't just a toy. It's a camera. And the moment you treat it like one, your results change.

So, here's the shift. Great directors don't just describe what they want to see. They direct how it's shown, why it matters, and what it should make you feel. And this this is the part that takes your work from random AI clips to scenes that actually mean something.

Let's dive into three pro-level prompt frameworks and lift your storytelling to a whole new level.

One, the hero shot formula for short, powerful moments. Perfect for Tik Toks, trailers, intros, or dramatic reveals. Prompt formula: character plus bold action plus slow camera move plus emotional lighting plus signature dialogue.

Example: A girl in a red hoodie stands on a rooftop, lightning flashing behind her. Camera slowly circles around. She looks into the lens and says, "I'm done hiding." Visual style, cinematic, dramatic shadows, rain falling. Why it works? You give Veo just enough to build a visually iconic moment instantly. I'm done hiding.

The scene sandwich for building longer stories. Think of this as scene setup, key moment, emotional beat. Example across three prompts. Prompt one, a boy runs into an empty stadium at sunset, out of breath, wide shot. Prompt two, close-up of his hands opening a worn journal. Wind blows. Text on screen. One more try. Prompt three. He walks onto the field alone. Camera follows from behind. Score rises. Why it works? You build a story rhythm through shots, not just words.

Three, the style first shot. For strong visual identity. Start with visual direction first, then add subject and action. Prompt formula. Visual style plus camera plus mood. Then character plus action. Example cinematic 4K ultra crisp shallow depth of field. Camera tilts up from the ground slowly. A violinist plays under a single spotlight on a dark stage. Why it works? When you're aiming for visual aesthetic, leading with style can guide the entire shot move.

That's it. You're not just writing prompts, you're directing shots. And yeah, AI tools like Veo are powerful, but not perfect. Sometimes you'll need to tweak, retry, refine. That's part of the craft.

So, next time, don't just ask what to show. Ask, "What should this moment feel like?" Cheat sheets in the description. Steal it. And if you want a full Veo film breakdown, comment below. I've got you. Low effort, high impact. Subscribe if you're into that.
