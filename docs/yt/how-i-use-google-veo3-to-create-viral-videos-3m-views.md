## Core Concepts

### Veo3 (Google V3)
- **Definition**: "Veo3, which is like the, you know, highest quality model"
- **Key Properties**:
  - Text-to-video generation
  - Generates both video and audio automatically
  - Cost: "$2 to $3 per shot"
  - Image-to-video exists but "these do not work that well yet"
  - No character consistency currently available
- **Related Concepts**: LLM-assisted video generation, AI commercial production

### Character Consistency Problem
- **Current Limitation**: "There's no character consistency. So, that's something that will be solved like eventually. You know, they're going to have like uh you can just upload a bunch of photos and then you can make them talk and you can make them walk, but that is not unfortunately where it's at now."
- **Workaround**: "You basically just have to describe them in detail the same way every time and just try and, you know, hope they look similar"
- **Example**: "an old guy with short gray hair, you know, like a UPS guy, you know, a white guy in his 30s with a mustache and a beard and like strong chin with muscular arms. Like get super detailed"

### Viral Content Formula
- **Hook Definition**: "your headline has like 0 2 seconds to get them to watch what your content is and then your content has like point or that has like two to three seconds to get them to stay for the whole video"
- **Mr. Beast Principle**: "the title of the video is more important than the thumbnail. And the thumbnail is more important than the actual content of the video"
- **Key Properties**:
  - Provocative statement
  - Credibility indicator
  - Trend-jacking element
  - Symmetry/contrast in numbers
  - Call to action

### Content Iteration Philosophy
- **95/5 Rule**: "this is honestly like the perfect Chachi BT thing because it's it's it's good. Like 95% of the jokes aren't that funny, but 5% actually are"
- **Process**: "And if you just prompt it enough to say like, 'Okay, give me 10 more. Okay, give me 10 more. Here's what I'm liking. Go in this direction. Make it unhinged. Make it like non sequators.' It's just going to keep"
- **Outcome**: "I would say like probably 70% of the lines in this are chat GBT, but it's not like a oneshot prompt"

## Procedures & Techniques

### Complete Veo3 Commercial Production Workflow

**Purpose**: Create viral AI-generated commercials that look professional and drive engagement

**Steps**:

1. **Ideation with ChatGPT**
   - "I like to just give it like very generalized instructions to begin with and then um you know just like let it give me something super cliche and then I'm going to tear it apart"
   - Initial prompt structure: "give me four scripts for a standard pharmaceutical commercial for the presentation for a fake medication that solves depression by taking a pill that's a play on words"
   - Add constraints: "commercial follows the same format or structure of a 20 or so second prescription commercial"
   - Iterate: "give me four uh prompt versions and then I kind of take the best lines and use that as like a a start a starting point"

2. **Finding the Viral Twist**
   - For beginners: "I know I can explore this type of commercial, but I want to have some sort of twist. can you give me five different twists on a pharmaceutical commercial that could be really funny if it's you know like let's just say it's SNL style"
   - Iterate until hook emerges: "you need to have some sort of kernel of an idea hook that's like oh this is unexpected"

3. **Script Development**
   - Request one-liners: "give me like comedic examples"
   - Refeed favorites: "I'm constantly refeeding my favorite lines in it so that it kind of like it learns and it updates"
   - Lock in core dialogue lines

4. **Prompt Structure Creation**
   - Take each dialogue line to ChatGPT: "give me using this prompt structure can you extrapolate you know a prompt you know using this prompt structure"
   - Character persistence: "Sarah says blank and it's like make Sarah, you know, a middle-aged woman in her 50s. And once you do this once, you can just feed it like Sarah says this, Dave says this"
   - Prompt requirements: "V3, you don't need this level of prompt structure. You basically just need to describe what's happening"
   - Include: "the pose, the shot type, the camera type, like what's happening in the background"
   - Essential: "you just need an overview of what's happening and then the dialogue that that guy says"

5. **Veo3 Generation**
   - Select model: "we just make sure that we're in um VO3, which is like the, you know, highest quality model"
   - "We only do one output per prompt"
   - Generate one at a time: "The reason I like to run it one at a time is because it's so expensive. So I'll kind of get feedback like you know is this working?"
   - Iteration rate: "I generated I don't know maybe like 30 clips or so to get like 10 good ones. So, it's like a 3:1 ratio maybe of like best generations. Actually, I didn't download all the ones that were bad. It was like a 5:1 ratio"

6. **Editing in Final Cut Pro/CapCut**
   - Import selected clips
   - Stitch together shot by shot
   - "this took me probably like half like half a day today. probably like 6 to 12 hours or so to do all this"

7. **Creating the Hook/Headline**
   - Example structure: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending 500K now? Steal my prompt below"
   - Components: credibility flex + cost contrast + question (drives replies) + value offer

8. **Distribution**
   - Post on X (Twitter) first
   - Cross-post to other platforms

**Prerequisites**:
- Access to ChatGPT/Claude/Grok
- Veo3 credits ($500 budget for full commercial)
- Video editing software
- Understanding of viral content mechanics

**Expected Outcome**:
- 10-12 final shots
- Total cost: ~$500 in credits
- Production time: 6-12 hours
- Potential for millions of views if hook and execution are strong

### Prompt Enhancement for Camera Movement

**Purpose**: Make AI-generated videos feel less robotic and more cinematic

**Technique**: "another thing you can do is like prompt camera movements in here. I think that's like the shots that like feel the most like non AI are probably the ones with like the coolest camera movement"

**Example**: "this one was like amazing and I prompted this like camera push in or dolly in and then it's like zooming in, but I'm also prompting or chat BT is prompting her emotion"

**Detailed Prompting**: "in this it's like describing it as like she coily like quips her response aware that she's making a joke about her husband's infidelity and like it comes through with that"

**Granular Control**: "in this one I prompted it to like at the end of the clip she glances up and there's a pea stain on her kitchen ceiling. So, you really can get really granular like with the details on this"

### Multi-LLM Ideation Strategy

**Purpose**: Get diverse creative outputs and avoid censorship limitations

**Technique**: "one hack I've been uh experimenting with is don't just use Chat GBT. Also try Claude and try Grock. uh Brock's like unhinged mode and fun mode and like I usually try two to three different models of like my initial idea and then depending on the which one I'll just use that"

**Model Selection**: "I would say overall humor-wise Chetchy PT is pretty good but um Grock sometimes gives me like insane stuff that Chetch would so censor"

### Portfolio Building Through Copying

**Purpose**: Learn commercial pacing and structure quickly as a beginner

**Controversial Technique**: "shot for shot at least in your own internal like when you're making a first couple commercials to like build out your portfolio. I don't care. This is very controversial, but I would say like just rip these shots shot for shot"

**Method**: "upload a screenshot to Chappie GPT of like the first frame of the commercial and say break this down into a prompt and then type that prompt in a VO3 and then like boom, you get your first shot"

**Critical Constraint**: "But don't do it for another knife commercial. Then do it for like a boot commercial or something like that. Something adjacent to where it's not like a direct ripoff. It's just kind of like the spirit of this"

**Philosophy**: "Steve Jobs said it best, great artist copy or good artist copy, great artist steal"

**Progression**: "when you work with templates of award-winning commercials and you tweak them and you adjust them and you make them unique on your own, that's how you can like instantly level up your skills as like a filmmaker editor is when you're kind of copying the greats and then and then over time you find your voice"

## Facts & Evidence

### Production Costs & Economics
- Traditional pharmaceutical commercial shoots: "anywhere from like 100k to a million"
- Veo3 pharmaceutical commercial cost: "$500 worth of credits"
- Individual shot cost: "$2 to $3 per shot"
- Final commercial: "10 or 12 shots"
- Time investment: "6 to 12 hours"
- Generation efficiency: "5:1 ratio" (5 generations to get 1 good shot)

### Viral Performance Examples
- PJ's posts: "Some of them have like a 100,000 likes"
- Cling 2.0 test: "$1,200 in credits testing its limits"
- Lord of the Rings Studio Ghibli: "$250 in cling credits and 9 hours editing"
- Removed viral post: "22 million views"
- Neural Viz growth: "6 months ago he had like no no views on his content" to "800k subscribers" with "18 million views" on some videos

### Platform Engagement Mechanics
- X (Twitter) hook window: "0 2 seconds to get them to watch"
- Content retention window: "two to three seconds to get them to stay for the whole video"
- Questions on X: "work really well on X because it generates replies and then that just feeds the algo"
- Click-ins signal: "when people click in that also tells the algorithm that this is good content"

### Content Format Preferences
- Modern consumption habits: "80 to 90% like just social episodic UGC content"
- Weekly episodic content preferred over long-form
- Traditional pharmaceutical commercial actors: "making like 2500 bucks per day to just say whatever the producers tell them"

## Expert Insights

### On Niche Selection and Personal Differentiation
- **Insight**: "riches are in the niches so then it's about okay how do I take these kind of processes that PJ's teaching and then apply it to my weird niche that other people want to consume"
- **Context**: Finding underserved markets with passionate communities

### On Commoditization of Production
- **Pattern**: "I think all production companies are going to be commoditized at some level if they're just making like what I would call cinematic blasé garbage, you know, just like it looks good, but there's no there's no real like soul to it"
- **Implication**: Technical quality alone won't sustain businesses; need unique voice/perspective

### On Content Abundance and AI Impact
- **Insight**: "content already is, you know, abundant. We're in a deluge of just an insane amount of content on a daily basis. But now with generative AI, it's it's honestly just going to get 10x 100x more"
- **Implication**: "it's not just about your ability to technically make something. It's about your ability to understand why people would want to watch the whole thing, share it with their friends"

### On Pricing and Value
- **Trade-off**: "even I can make a bombastic statement like this cost me $500 in credits, but like it's the whole Picasso metaphor of like, you know, he like draws on a napkin in 30 seconds. They were like, why why are you going to charge me like 40 grand for it? It took you 30 seconds. He's like, no, it took me like 30 years to understand how to do this"
- **Principle**: "I don't recommend people do content for less than five grand because even though this is stuff is easy, it's still your skill as a filmmaker is worth the time"

### On Consulting Pricing
- **Pattern**: "the scale of the company. You charge more. That's it. It's the same content. If you're doing it for a small company, you charge a little bit. If you're doing it for a big company, you charge more"

### On Long-Form vs Episodic Content
- **Insight**: "I'm actually not that bullish on long form content with generative AI because I think the space iterates too fast and like the first bit of your film can look good and then the last bit of your film can look bad"
- **Better Approach**: "creating like episodic weekly content is by far what's like the new economy"

### On Taste and Style
- **Outsourcing Taste**: "if you don't have the taste, you can kind of outsource taste and you could say, you know, let's say you like Seth Rogan, you'd say like, create jokes that I think Seth Rogan would like"
- **Alternative**: "Create jokes in the style of Seth Rogan or like imagine your Bill Burr doing a standup comedy routine"

### On Finding Ideas
- **Reference Mining**: "I basically just took jokes from uh the deep thoughts with Jack Handy from SNL and then I just reconstituted those jokes into like you know VO3 settings"
- **Format Adaptation**: "taking a popular social format, i.e. Man on the street videos or the Zillow videos or he kind of has like a mock Joe Rogan set and then he's doing it with a twist i.e. Alien"

### On Authenticity in Pharmaceutical Commercials
- **Perspective**: "they're all scripted [ __ ] regardless. Like the people who are like, 'Well, it's not authentic testimonials.' It never was authentic testimonials"
- **Context**: Defending AI-generated pharmaceutical content

## Warnings & Pitfalls

### Veo3 Audio Issues
- **Common Problem**: "Unfortunately, uh it is a it is a slot machine. No matter how great you prompt and I you know like the pro tips, it's still sometimes randomly like they won't talk at all"
- **Why It Fails**: Technical limitation of current model
- **Status**: "I've been talking with the Google team. They're like obviously actively aware of of that problem where there's no audio and then they're also aware of the subtitle issue"

### Subtitle Gibberish Problem
- **Issue**: Veo3 generates "weird gibberish subtitles underneath"
- **Better Approach**: "if you um don't include uh quotes, so actually I should I'd learn this later, but don't include quotes and then it will be less likely to generate like weird gibberish subtitles"

### Audio Quality Limitations
- **Problem**: "it sounds really thin. Like they don't have like a deep EQ spectrum on the voices"
- **Limitation**: "there's also obviously no voice consistency"

### Image-to-Video Not Ready
- **Current State**: "There is technically um like images to video that they have or ingredients, but these do not work that well yet. Um they're just not they're just not that good"
- **Implication**: Stick to text-to-video for now

### Character Regeneration Unpredictability
- **Warning**: "if you don't quite like grandma's performance, like you just have to hit enter again, maybe make some tweaks, and she's going to show up in a different thing"
- **Context**: No way to iterate on same character, must regenerate entirely

### Avoiding Cliché Hooks
- **Common Mistake**: "Here's what I hate. I don't think anyone should use like this is crazy. Hollywood is cooked. Oh my god, what the [ __ ]"
- **Why It Fails**: "Yes, it works. That's the problem of why everyone does it"
- **Better Approach**: "you actually should do that, but not with those specific words. You need to find like your own kind of words"

### Minimum Pricing Constraint
- **Warning**: "I don't recommend people do content for less than five grand because even though this is stuff is easy, it's still your skill as a filmmaker is worth the time"
- **Context**: Maintaining professional value in age of AI commoditization

### Course Monetization Skepticism
- **Limitation**: "I don't like recommending this because it's like, how do you monetize being a marketer? Well, you sell courses as a marketer to other marketers. Like, okay. So, like it's it's just an MLM"
- **Context**: Courses can work but shouldn't be primary monetization strategy

## 10 Monetization Strategies

### 1. Brand Building Through Portfolio
- **Strategy**: "use V3 to build a brand for yourself. This this first one is more of like just use this to get into the ecosystem of creating content that that in a general sense like is content you're proud of and can lead to downstream work"
- **Application**: Create viral content to attract direct clients

### 2. Direct-to-Client Commercial Production
- **Target Markets**: "pharmaceutical companies", "beer companies", "different restaurants", "feastables like CPG brands", "underwear brands"
- **Better Niches**: "food products are really smart", "BookTok. Romanticy talk slash, you know, kind of uh fan. Yeah. Romanticy basically like reaching out to authors and doing book promos for them doing scenes from their book"
- **Pricing**: "anywhere from like five grand on the low end"
- **Value Prop**: "brands that would love unhinged special effects kind of uh shots that you can do with AI that all these agencies are like they they could never do for those budgets"

### 3. Agency Partnerships
- **Approach**: "build a portfolio um and let agencies work with you"
- **Niche Strategy**: "if you're you're more starting out as a filmmaker, like I said, it's like really keep it niche to what interests you"
- **Philosophy**: "lean into your own interests and weirdness and niche and then figure out how to like work with brands who are the at the end of the day the ones who have money to spend um to kind of productize your unique point of view"

### 4. Narrative Series with Brand Integrations
- **Example**: Neural Viz "moniverse" - alien world discovering human artifacts
- **Method**: "if he really wanted to monetize the crap out of this, he could just do product integrations where these aliens find uh you know artifacts from our time. And it's like just you know like Tabasco sauce like work with Tabasco"
- **Pitch**: "look hey I get you know whatever like 18 million views on my video. Um what's it worth to you to have the aliens like you know find a Tabasco sauce and worship this"

### 5. Digital Products & Courses
- **Products**: "a course or it could be like a PDF or a digital product that you're bundling up and then you're selling"
- **Skepticism**: Noted as MLM-like but acknowledged as viable

### 6. Enterprise Consulting
- **Market**: "Fortune 500 companies"
- **Value Prop**: "we figured out how to not just be like uh create great content with generative AI but we've also figured out how do we keep it within your legal compliance constraints"
- **Knowledge Areas**: "the models that are kind of give you indemnification for you know like your you know company uh security procedures"
- **Earnings**: "these guys make like six figures"
- **Pricing Strategy**: "the scale of the company. You charge more"
- **Entry Point**: "$1,500 training"

### 7. Sketch Comedy Channel
- **Style**: "key and peel style uh sketch comedy show"
- **Challenge**: "it's a bit harder to do brand integrations"
- **Proof of Concept**: "TikTok actually shows that this is possible if you can get a big enough uh audience"
- **Example**: "Bang energy drinks...at all points in the uh comedy bits, they have like a product integration"

### 8. Episodic Content (Not Long-Form Films)
- **Warning Against Long-Form**: "I'm actually not that bullish on long form content with generative AI because I think the space iterates too fast and like the first bit of your film can look good and then the last bit of your film can look bad"
- **Recommendation**: "creating like episodic weekly content is by far what's like the new economy"
- **Market Alignment**: "people's consumption habits these days is like 80 to 90% like just social episodic UGC content"

### 9. Branded Narrative Series
- **Approach**: "we'll do this, you know, kind of alien style universe like but with your brand. We'll make funny content but like all like like before all the relics and artifacts are just in your brand"
- **Pricing Example**: "We'll do a whole, you know, 10 episode narrative series. It's like 2 minutes a pop and you know charge you 10 20 grand on this"

### 10. Underserved Niche Content
- **Example**: "we're doing the story of Jonah, which is like a Bible content. Um, look, it's like open- sourced uh IP, if you will, like the Bible. It's got like two billion daily active users"
- **Market Dynamics**: "the supply is low of content that's like Bible films and the demand is super huge"
- **Quality Tolerance**: "Even 6 months ago when the quality was bad, they're still like, 'Oh, this is amazing.'"
- **Monetization**: "Working with uh studios to make like faith films and stuff like that"

## Examples

### Example 1: Pharmaceutical Commercial "Puppine"
- **Scenario**: Friend asked for pharmaceutical commercial quote
- **Application**: Started making standard commercial, got bored, added satirical twist midway
- **Evolution**: "what if it's like a placebo pill that they sent you and then they just actually ship you like a dog 3 days later?" → friend suggested "it secretes pherommones. Like this is like real scientific breakthrough that like it attracts puppies"
- **Outcome**: Went viral, demonstrated $500k → $500 cost reduction narrative
- **Lesson**: "in the be in the beginning you're watching it and you're like I've seen this commercial beforeh and then there was like an emotional roller coaster of like, wait, is this a joke? Is this AI? What's happening here?"

### Example 2: Successful X Post Structure
- **Headline**: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending 500K now? Steal my prompt below"
- **Breakdown**:
  - Credibility: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. That's kind of like a low-key flex"
  - Trend-jacking: "I was able to do this for $500 with V3, which is like a bit of trending jacking"
  - Symmetry: "500k to $500, like that symmetry"
  - Engagement: "Questions work really well on X because it generates replies and then that just feeds the algo"
  - Value: "steal my prompt is just like here's you know check out this value"

### Example 3: Other Viral Post Patterns
- "AI video quality just 10xed overnight. I'm speechless. Cling 2.0 just dropped and I've already burned through $1,200 in credits testing its limits. I've never seen motion this fluid or this accurate. Here's how I made this video step by step"
- "What if Studio Gibli directed Lord of the Rings? I spent 250 in cling credits and 9 hours editing the Fellowship trailer. And I'll show you exactly how I did it"
- Pattern: Provocative statement + Investment claim + Process reveal

### Example 4: ChatGPT Twist Generation
- **Prompt**: "I want to do a pharma commercial, but have some sort of satirical SNL style twist on it that makes it funny and could be viral. Give me 10 ideas"
- **Output Examples**:
  - "No more calls for people whose parents call them too much. Um, the drug numbs the emotional guilt response"
  - "Invisa RX for people who want to ghost without the guilt"
  - "Easy text. Uh help you stop texting your ex"
- **Outcome**: Instantly generated "peppermint" from conversation history

### Example 5: One-Liner Generation
- **Approach**: Request comedic one-liners repeatedly
- **Examples Generated**:
  - "peppermint transformed me and my Babe Ruth card collection" (irony: dog tore up cards)
  - "He licks my toes almost as much as my late husband used to"
  - "I found a beagle and lost custody of my recliner"
  - "He only pees on the things he loves"
  - "he listens twice as good as my ex-husband and only humps half as many of my friends"
- **Adaptation**: "I couldn't get V3 to say humps humps my friends. So, I had to say he climbs into the lap of half as many of my friends"

### Example 6: Neural Viz Universe Building
- **Concept**: "moniverse" - alien world 1000 years in future questioning if humans were real
- **Format Adaptations**:
  - "House Hunters but in this weird alien universe"
  - Man-on-the-street interviews with aliens
  - Mock Joe Rogan set
- **Growth**: 0 views 6 months ago → 800k subscribers with 18M view videos
- **Monetization**: Merch + Patreon currently, could add brand integrations

### Example 7: Tim and Eric Pharmaceutical Parody
- **Concept**: "you want to fast forward time. This pill will knock you out until like so open your calendar app and then select what day you want to fast forward to"
- **Execution**: Jeff Goldblum hosts, character wakes up "in a catatonic state like four weeks later"
- **Side effects**: "cardiac arrest like not waking up all this fun"
- **Lesson**: Execution and polish matter for comedic timing
