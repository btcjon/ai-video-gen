## WHY IMPERFECTIONS MATTER

Perfect = Fake. The uncanny valley effect happens when everything is too clean, too symmetrical, too ideal. Real humans and environments have flaws, and these flaws create authenticity and emotional connection.

## PROMPT INTEGRATION TIPS

### Natural Integration
Instead of listing imperfections separately, weave them into descriptions:

❌ Wrong: "Woman. Has pores. Has stray hair. Has wrinkles in clothes."

✅ Right: "Woman with visible pores on her sun-kissed face, wisps of hair escaping her ponytail and catching the backlight, her linen shirt showing natural wrinkles from the day's wear"

### Context Appropriate
Match imperfections to situation:
- **Morning**: Slight puffiness, bed head, wrinkled pajamas
- **End of workday**: Slight makeup wear, tired eyes, wrinkled clothes
- **Exercise**: Sweat, flushed skin, messy hair
- **Outdoor**: Wind-blown hair, sun squint, dust on clothes

### Character Appropriate
- **Parent**: Tired eyes, practical hairstyle, stained clothes
- **Professional**: Controlled but present imperfections
- **Teen**: Acne, awkward posture, ill-fitting clothes
- **Elder**: Age spots, wrinkles, thinning hair

## REMEMBER

The goal isn't to make things ugly—it's to make them real. These imperfections should feel natural, unnoticed consciously but felt subconsciously. They create the texture of life that makes viewers believe what they're seeing.

**When in doubt**: Look at real life. Real people. Real environments. Reality is never perfect, and that's what makes it beautiful and believable.
