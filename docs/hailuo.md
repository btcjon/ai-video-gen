**[Camera Shot + Motion] + [Subject + Description] + [Action] + [Scene + Description] + [Lighting] + [Style/Mood]**

### Breakdown by Component

|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Camera Shot + Motion** | Virtual camera position and movement | Medium shot, slow panning right, dolly zoom, drone shot flying over |
| **Subject + Description** | Main character with specific details | A grizzled old sailor with white beard; Young woman with long red hair in green cloak |
| **Action** | What the subject is doing | Staring intently at compass; Casting magical spell with glowing hands |
| **Scene + Description** | Environment and background | Wooden ship deck during storm; Dense foggy forest at night |
| **Lighting** | Light source and quality | Golden hour sunlight; dramatic Rembrandt lighting; soft moonlight |
| **Style/Mood** | Overall aesthetic and tone | Cinematic movie style; hyper-realistic 8k; somber melancholic mood |

## Professional Prompting Techniques

### Master Cinematic Language
Use professional cinematography terms for sophisticated results :[2]
- **Camera movements**: "dolly zoom," "Dutch angle," "rack focus"
- **Shot types**: "establishing shot," "match cut," "POV shot"
- **Lighting**: "Rembrandt lighting," "rim lighting," "practical lighting"

### Character Consistency Secrets
Reddit users report these techniques work best :[4][2]

1. **Be Hyper-Specific**: Instead of "a man," write "A 40-year-old man named Alex with short brown hair, small scar above left eyebrow, worn brown leather jacket, blue jeans"

2. **Copy-Paste Descriptions**: Use identical character descriptions across all prompts for that character

3. **Anchor with Unique Features**: Use distinctive elements like "woman with silver locket necklace" to maintain consistency[2]

4. **Multi-Image References**: Upload multiple angles of the same character when using Subject Reference feature[4]

## Advanced User Tips from the Community

### Motion Control Mastery
Build complexity gradually :[5]
1. Start with basic movements: "Woman walks slowly towards house"
2. Add expressions: "Woman slowly opens brown eyes and smiles softly"
3. Combine elements: "Woman quickly turns around with fearful expression"
4. Add camera movement: "Camera pans left revealing creepy monster in dimly lit room"

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

**Prevent "Cartoon" Look** :[2]
- Add: "photorealistic, hyper-detailed, shot on Arri Alexa, 8k, cinematic movie style"
- Specify: "natural lighting, soft light"
- Use negative prompts: "NOT cartoon, anime, illustration"

**Ground Prompts in Reality** :[6]
- Use real-world settings instead of fantastical elements
- Avoid "lasers and aliens" which increase CGI-like appearance

### Professional Workflow Tips

**Shot Sequencing for Narratives** :[2]
1. **Establishing Shot**: "Wide shot of medieval castle at dusk"
2. **Medium Shot**: "Medium shot of queen looking out castle window"  
3. **Close-up**: "Close-up on queen's hand nervously twisting ring"

**Prompt Length Strategy** :[6]
- Simple prompts often work better than overly complex ones
- Focus on one clear action per video
- Use specific rather than vague descriptions

## Image-to-Video Best Practices

### Optimal Image Requirements
- Use high-resolution, clear images[2]
- Ensure good lighting and contrast
- Avoid cluttered backgrounds

### Motion Prompt Strategy
Focus prompts on desired movement rather than describing the entire scene :[2]
- For lake scene: "Water ripples gently, clouds drift slowly across sky"
- For portrait: "Subject blinks slowly, slight head turn to left"

### Camera Control Tips[7]
- Be explicit: "zoom in," "pan right," "tracking shot"
- Avoid vague instructions like "dynamic movement"
- Test different motion intensities

## Pro User Secrets

- Generate 3 videos at once to maximize credit efficiency[1]
- Use the AI brainstorming feature for prompt ideas

### Quality Enhancement Techniques
- Use "shot on professional camera" for realistic look

This feature maintains character consistency across videos :[8]
1. Upload clear reference image of character
2. Use same character description in all related prompts
3. Test different scenarios while maintaining core features
4. Build character library for ongoing projects

### Multi-Scene Storytelling
Plan video sequences like a film director :[5]

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overly Complex Prompts**: Keep each video focused on one clear action

3. **Ignoring Lighting**: Always specify lighting conditions
4. **Vague Camera Instructions**: Be specific about camera movements
