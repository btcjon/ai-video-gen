## Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: The Vulnerability (Text-to-Video)
**Duration**: 0:00-0:08
**Purpose**: Establish water crisis scenario
**Generation Method**: Text-to-video (no product)

**Prompt**:
```
Cinematic wide shot of a prepared homestead at golden hour, 50mm lens at F2.8 creating shallow depth of field. Camera slowly dollies forward revealing rain barrels, solar panels, and a vegetable garden. A weathered man in tactical pants and earth-tone shirt inspects murky water in a mason jar against the fading light, concern visible in his expression. Natural skin texture with visible pores, slight stubble, crow's feet showing years of outdoor experience. 2:1 exposure ratio with warm key light from setting sun creating long shadows. Dust particles float through volumetric light rays. Atmosphere includes distant emergency sirens and radio static. Color palette: 60% earth tones, 30% muted greens, 10% amber highlights. Include subtle lens flare from sun, slight heat distortion over distant fields. (no subtitles) (no text overlays) (avoid perfect skin) (include natural imperfections)
```

### Scene 2: The Threat Reality (Text-to-Video)
**Duration**: 0:08-0:16
**Purpose**: Show contamination risks
**Generation Method**: Text-to-video (no product)

**Prompt**:
```
Handheld documentary-style footage, 35mm lens at F4 with slight camera shake for urgency. Close-up shots intercut rapidly: contaminated creek water with visible debris and oil sheen, boil water notice taped to a community board with edges peeling, empty store shelves where water cases should be. A prepper's gloved hand tests murky water with a TDS meter showing dangerous readings. Harsh 4:1 exposure ratio creating dramatic shadows. Visible dirt under fingernails, fabric wear on gloves, authentic grime. Atmospheric haze and particulate matter in air. Color grading: 60% desaturated blues, 30% grays, 10% warning amber. Natural film grain, slight motion blur on quick pans. Background sounds of water dripping, distant thunder. (no narration) (no captions) (realistic textures) (weathered materials)
```

### Scene 3: Discovery Moment (Image-to-Video) ⚠️ PRODUCT
**Duration**: 0:16-0:24
**Purpose**: First product appearance
**Generation Method**: IMAGE-TO-VIDEO REQUIRED

**Prompt**:
```
Prepared man's weathered hands carefully retrieve this blue bottle product from a well-organized bug-out bag, 85mm lens at F2.8 with creamy bokeh. Slow deliberate movement as fingers wrap around this product, lifting it into frame with practiced precision. Natural calluses on hands, dirt under nails, small scars from outdoor work. Soft 2:1 exposure ratio with window light creating gentle highlights on this product's surface. Visible fingerprints on bottle, authentic wear marks. Background shows organized prep supplies slightly out of focus. Color: 60% neutral tactical colors, 30% product blue, 10% brass zipper accents. Dust motes drift through light beam. (no dialogue) (no text) (show this product being handled) (authentic grip)
```

### Scene 4: Field Testing (Image-to-Video) ⚠️ PRODUCT
**Duration**: 0:24-0:32
**Purpose**: Demonstrate field use
**Generation Method**: IMAGE-TO-VIDEO REQUIRED

**Prompt**:
```
Field testing scene with this product in use, 50mm lens at F4 for balanced depth. Experienced prepper carefully measures drops from this blue bottle into a metal camping cup filled with questionable water from a stream. Hands show authentic outdoor wear - sun-weathered skin, visible veins, small cuts healing. Natural 3:1 exposure ratio with dappled forest light through trees. This product held steady, drops falling precisely. Visible condensation on metal cup, real water ripples, authentic outdoor elements. Background shows tactical backpack, map, compass slightly blurred. Color: 60% forest greens, 30% earth browns, 10% product blue accent. Include insect movement, leaves rustling. (no narration) (practical demonstration) (this product in action)
```

### Scene 5: The Transformation (Image-to-Video) ⚠️ PRODUCT
**Duration**: 0:32-0:40
**Purpose**: Show results
**Generation Method**: IMAGE-TO-VIDEO REQUIRED

**Prompt**:
```
Split-screen style shot showing before/after water samples with this product placed between them, 100mm macro lens at F8 for maximum sharpness. Left glass shows murky contaminated water, right glass crystal clear after treatment. This blue bottle centered as the hero element. Natural lighting at 2:1 ratio highlighting the dramatic difference. Visible sediment settling in left glass, pristine clarity in right glass. Realistic water refraction, authentic glass imperfections, natural reflections. Table shows wear marks, tactical notebook with prep calculations visible. Color: 60% neutral grays, 30% water blues, 10% product accent. Condensation on glasses, dust particles in light beam. (no speech) (visual demonstration) (this product as solution)
```

### Scene 6: Community Validation (Image-to-Video) ⚠️ PRODUCT
**Duration**: 0:40-0:48
**Purpose**: Trust building
**Generation Method**: IMAGE-TO-VIDEO REQUIRED

**Prompt**:
```
Prepper meetup scene with multiple people examining this product, 35mm lens at F5.6 for group depth. Three preppers of different ages - older veteran with gray beard, middle-aged woman in tactical vest, younger man with survival bracelet - passing this blue bottle between them, nodding with approval. Authentic details: weathered skin, calloused hands, practical clothing with wear patterns, visible EDC gear. Natural 2:1 outdoor lighting under a canopy. This product being demonstrated to the group. Background shows trucks with CB antennas, camping gear, solar chargers. Color: 60% earth tones, 30% tactical blacks, 10% product blue. Natural movement, genuine reactions. (community setting) (this product being shared) (trust signals)

## Success Metrics
- ✓ Product consistency across all product scenes
- ✓ Prepper community authentic representation
- ✓ 56 seconds total (platform compliant)
- ✓ Cinema-grade technical specifications
- ✓ Self-contained generation commands
- ✓ Clear call to action for preparedness

## Cost Analysis
- 7 scenes × $0.38 (veo3_fast) = $2.66 for testing
- 7 scenes × $1.50 (veo3 quality) = $10.50 for final
- Recommended: Test with veo3_fast, then regenerate best performers with veo3
