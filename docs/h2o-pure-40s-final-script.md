# H2O Pure 40s TikTok Script - Final Version

I didn't realize how dangerous camping water was until my daughter got E. coli from a 'clear' stream. I'm a mom who loves hiking—

I tried pump filters—they clog. Boiling takes forever. Chemical tablets taste disgusting and don't kill everything.

That's when I found H2O Pure. Tiny 6ml bottle—8 drops per gallon, wait an hour, destroys E. coli, salmonella, everything.

99% natural copper and zinc. lab-proven. No weird taste, no moving parts. One bottle treats 15+ gallons. 3 cents per gallon.

I keep one everywhere, car, hiking pack, home. Its Made in the USA, 30-day guarantee. Link in bio. Your family's safety is worth it.
