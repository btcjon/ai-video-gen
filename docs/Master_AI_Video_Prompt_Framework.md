## 🔑 THE 10 ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS (Use ALL)

### 1. SCENE SUMMARY
One clear cinematic sentence describing the transformation or key moment.

**Example:**
```
A cold Corona bottle transforms into a full beach rave as the environment 
explodes from inside, with palm trees rising and party lights stringing 
themselves across the beach at sunset
```

### 2. SUBJECT DESCRIPTION (With Intentional Imperfections)
Rich detail including appearance, clothing, physical features, AND realistic flaws.

**For Products:**
```
Cold, dewy Corona bottle with condensation dripping, label showing slight 
moisture wrinkles, glass reflecting golden hour light with fingerprint 
visible near top
```

**For People:**
```
28-year-old woman with olive skin showing visible pores and natural texture, 
shoulder-length brown hair with stray strands catching light, genuine smile 
revealing crow's feet, wearing casual beige sweater with visible fabric pilling
```

### 3. BACKGROUND & ENVIRONMENT
Expand the setting with atmospheric details.

**Example:**
```
Weathered beach table on sandy shore, weathered wood showing age and wear, 
sunset sky transitioning from golden orange to deep blue twilight, palm 
trees silhouetted in distance, gentle waves visible in soft focus background
```

### 4. ACTION SEQUENCE (Physics-Aware)
Describe what happens with realistic movement and timing. **ONE primary action per 8-second clip.**

**Step-by-Step Format:**
```
At 0-2 seconds: Bottle begins to hum and vibrate gently
At 2-3 seconds: Bottle cap pops off in slow motion
At 3-6 seconds: Palm trees rise from sand, lights string themselves overhead, 
DJ booth assembles from driftwood
At 6-8 seconds: Full beach rave materializes, music kicks in, bottle remains 
in foreground as hero
```

### 5. VIDEO STYLE & AESTHETIC
Always specify the look and professional reference.

**Examples:**
- `cinematic photorealistic professional film look`
- `A24 indie film aesthetic with muted color palette`
- `Apple product launch style minimalism`
- `BBC Planet Earth documentary quality`
- `Christopher Nolan epic scale with chiaroscuro lighting`

### 6. CAMERA INSTRUCTIONS
Shot type, movement, angle, and lens specs.

**Complete Camera Specification:**
```
Camera starts ultra close on bottle with 85mm macro lens at F2.8, then 
zooms out smoothly while craning overhead as environment expands, ending 
in wide shot capturing full scene, handheld movement with natural shake, 
low angle emphasizing scale at climax
```

**Camera Movement Types:**
- `dolly in/out` - smooth forward/backward
- `pan left/right` - horizontal rotation
- `tilt up/down` - vertical rotation
- `tracking shot` - follows subject
- `crane up/down` - vertical height change
- `orbit/circular` - revolves around subject
- `handheld` - natural shake and movement
- `fixed/static` - no movement

**Shot Types:**
- `extreme close-up (ECU)` - single feature fills frame
- `close-up (CU)` - face or object detail
- `medium shot (MS)` - waist up
- `medium wide (MW)` - full body with space
- `wide shot (WS)` - full environment establishing
- `extreme wide (EWS)` - vast scale emphasis

### 7. COMPOSITION & FRAMING
Professional framing that emphasizes subject.

**Compositional Techniques:**
```
Subject positioned on right third line following rule of thirds, leading 
lines from beach converge toward bottle, symmetrical framing as party 
builds around center bottle, foreground-midground-background layering 
creates depth
```

### 8. LIGHTING & MOOD (With Exposure Ratios)
Realistic cinematic lighting matching the mood.

**Complete Lighting Specification:**
```
Golden hour backlight creating 4:1 exposure ratio with long dramatic shadows, 
warm edge lighting on bottle, transitioning to cool blue moonlight as night 
falls, neon party lights adding colorful accents, volumetric god rays through 
palm trees, atmospheric haze catching light
```

**Exposure Ratios:**
- **2:1** - Soft professional look (MOST RECOMMENDED)
- **4:1** - Dramatic but controlled
- **8:1** - High drama, deep shadows
- **16:1+** - Extreme noir contrast

### 9. AUDIO DESIGN (Equal Partner to Visuals)
Dialogue, SFX, music, and ambient sounds with timing.

**Complete Audio Specification:**
```
Audio: At 0-2s subtle ambient beach sounds with low rumble; at 2-3s crisp 
bottle cap pop with high-frequency ring; at 3-6s whooshing assembly sounds 
with rising electronic music build; at 6-8s full EDM track kicks in with 
crowd energy, waves crashing, fire crackling. Music style: progressive house 
with tropical vibes. (no subtitles)
```

**Audio Components:**
- **Music**: Style, emotional arc, build/drop points
- **SFX**: Specific sounds at precise moments
- **Ambient**: Environmental audio layer
- **Dialogue**: Exact words with vocal tone (if applicable)
- **ASMR**: Micro-level detail sounds

### 10. COLOR PALETTE (60-30-10 Rule)
Cohesive cinematic tones that enhance mood.

**Example:**
```
Color palette: 60% warm golden sunset oranges and yellows (dominant environment), 
30% deep blue twilight sky and ocean (supporting), 10% vibrant neon pinks and 
cyans from party lights (accent pops)
```

### 11. EMOTIONAL TONE
Explicitly state desired viewer feeling.

**Examples:**
- `Viewers should feel excitement and energy building to climax`
- `Evokes nostalgia and warmth, intimate and personal`
- `Creates tension and unease, slightly unsettling`
- `Inspires awe and wonder at scale and beauty`

### 12. NEGATIVE INSTRUCTIONS (Critical!)
Prevents 80% of common failures.

**Universal Negatives:**
```
No subtitles, no text overlays, no distortions, no unrealistic proportions, 
no flickering, no extra characters not specified, no unnatural movements, 
no impossible physics, no jarring cuts, no inconsistent lighting
```

## 📋 TWO PROMPT FORMATS: When to Use Each

### PARAGRAPH FORMAT (90% of Use Cases)

**Best For:**
- Social media content
- Personal projects
- Quick generations
- Simple single-character scenes
- General storytelling

**Structure:**
Write as one continuous cinematic paragraph incorporating all 10 components naturally.

**Example:**
```
A sleek emerald-green glass fountain pen with gold trim and visible fingerprint 
smudges glides slowly across crisp parchment paper, but instead of ink, lush 
green vines, tiny leaves, and blooming flowers sprout instantly from the tip, 
curling and weaving across the page in organic patterns. The background is a 
warm wooden desk bathed in soft morning sunlight with 2:1 exposure ratio, with 
drifting dust particles catching light beams creating volumetric effects. Shot 
as an ultra-detailed macro with 100mm lens at F2.8 aperture, camera slowly 
dollies in on the sprouting plants, cinematic lighting with golden warmth, 
shallow depth of field keeping pen in sharp focus while background blurs. 
Subtle audio of pen nib scratching, gentle rustling of growing leaves, soft 
ambient morning sounds, no music. Color palette: 60% warm wood browns and 
golden light, 30% rich green plant life, 10% metallic gold accents on pen. 
The scene evokes magical realism and wonder, nature's power emerging from human 
tools. No subtitles, no text overlays, no unnatural movements, natural organic 
growth patterns throughout.
```

## 🎬 FRAME-TO-FRAME WORKFLOW FOR LONG VIDEOS

### The 8-Second Reality
**VEO 3 Maximum**: 8 seconds per clip (CANNOT be extended)  
**Solution**: Frame-to-video continuation for seamless longer content

### 🚨 THE 7 CRITICAL RULES FOR MULTI-SCENE SUCCESS

#### RULE 1: FACE MUST BE VISIBLE IN ENDING FRAME ⚠️ MANDATORY
**Why**: VEO 3 cannot maintain character consistency without facial reference.

**Ending Frame Requirements:**
- [ ] Character's face clearly visible (not turned away)
- [ ] Face showing at chest level or closer (not distant)
- [ ] 3/4 profile minimum (full face preferred)
- [ ] Good lighting on face
- [ ] Expression visible

**Examples:**
- ❌ WRONG: Character walking away, back to camera, face obscured
- ✅ RIGHT: Character in 3/4 profile facing camera at scene end

#### RULE 2: ONE ACTION PER 8-SECOND SCENE
**Why**: Cramming multiple actions results in incomplete execution.

**Action Density Formula:**
```
Scene 1: ONE action (8 seconds)
  0-2s: Setup
  2-6s: Main action
  6-8s: Completion/transition

NOT THIS:
Scene 1: FOUR actions (8 seconds)
  0-2s: Action A
  2-4s: Action B  
  4-6s: Action C
  6-8s: Action D
  Result: None fully executed
```

**Examples:**
- ❌ WRONG: "Walk to camp + arrive + interact + demonstrate" (4 actions)
- ✅ RIGHT: "Walk to camp and arrive" (1 action) → Next scene: "Interact and demonstrate"

#### RULE 3: MAINTAIN CONTINUITY BETWEEN SCENES
**Why**: Skipping logical steps breaks visual flow.

**Continuity Planning:**
```
Scene 3 ends: Man sitting by fire at night
Scene 4 MUST start: Man sitting by fire at night, then [new action]

NOT: Man already standing at camp (broken continuity)
```

**Examples:**
- ❌ WRONG: Scene N ends sitting → Scene N+1 starts standing at different location
- ✅ RIGHT: Scene N ends sitting → Scene N+1 starts sitting, then stands

#### RULE 4: USE JSON FOR COMPLEX SCENES
**When to Use JSON:**
- Multiple characters
- Camera movements with precise timing
- Complex lighting transitions
- Character interactions
- Detailed transformations

**When Plain Text is OK:**
- Simple single-character continuity
- Straightforward actions
- Basic scene progression

#### RULE 5: PLAN TRANSITIONS, DON'T SKIP THEM
**Why**: Major location/time changes need transition scenes.

**Examples:**
- ❌ WRONG: Forest → teleport to camp
- ✅ RIGHT: Forest → see lights → walk toward lights → arrive at camp (2-3 scenes)

#### RULE 6: ESTABLISH ENVIRONMENTAL AESTHETICS AT TRANSITION
**Why**: Major style changes (day→night, location shifts) need clear visual direction.

**Environmental Transition Descriptions:**

**Night Transition:**
```
ending with deep blue twilight, first stars visible, silver moonlight 
beginning to illuminate scene, cool color temperature establishing night 
aesthetic, shadows deepening naturally
```

**Dawn Transition:**
```
ending with warm golden orange horizon, soft pink sky, warm color 
temperature, volumetric morning mist rolling in, light quality shifting 
from blue to gold
```

**Indoor→Outdoor:**
```
ending with natural daylight flooding in through opening, warm vs cool 
contrast, clear weather conditions visible, eyes adjusting to brightness
```

#### RULE 7: PRODUCT VISIBILITY THROUGHOUT CHAIN ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Why**: Once product disappears, VEO 3 cannot accurately recreate it.

**The Product Continuity Problem:**
- VEO 3 cannot recreate branded products (logos, labels, specific designs)
- If product exits frame → Next scene hallucinates incorrect product or omits it
- Manual compositing is time-consuming and may not match lighting/angle

**Strategy A: Keep Product Visible (Preferred)**
```
✅ Scene 2: Character discovers product → holds in hands
✅ Scene 3: Still holding product, adds drops to water jug
✅ Scene 4: Product visible beside character during wait
✅ Scene 5: Picks up product again to demonstrate
```

**Strategy B: Plan for Manual Compositing**
```
✅ Scene 2: Character examines generic bottle
   Ending frame: Bottle at chest level, clear view, good lighting
   → Manually composite real product in post
✅ Scene 3: Use composited ending frame as starting point
```

**Ending Frame Requirements for Compositing:**
- [ ] Product in clear, unobstructed view
- [ ] Good lighting on product area
- [ ] Angle suitable for placement (not extreme perspective)
- [ ] Character's hand position/grip visible if held

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Scene 2 ends with product → Scene 3 starts without product
- ❌ Product too small/obscured in ending frame
- ❌ Product at extreme angle in ending
- ❌ Assuming VEO 3 can recreate branded product from description

### The Frame Continuation Method

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**1. Generate Initial Scene**
```json
{
  "scene": "Scene 1 - Introduction",
  "prompt": "45-year-old father with salt-and-pepper hair checking emergency 
  supplies in dimly lit garage, worried expression, wearing gray t-shirt, 
  cinematic lighting with 2:1 ratio, handheld camera, shallow depth of field, 
  ending with his face visible in 3/4 profile"
}
```

**2. Extract Last Frame**
```bash
# FFmpeg method
ffmpeg -sseof -1 -i scene1.mp4 -vframes 1 scene1_ending.jpg

# Or extract at specific timestamp (7.9s for 8s video)
ffmpeg -i scene1.mp4 -ss 00:00:07.900 -vframes 1 scene1_ending.jpg
```

**3. Generate Continuation (85% Same)**
```json
{
  "scene": "Scene 2 - Continuation",
  "starting_image": "scene1_ending.png",
  "prompt": "45-year-old father with salt-and-pepper hair finding water bottle 
  among emergency supplies in dimly lit garage, relieved expression, wearing 
  gray t-shirt, cinematic lighting with 2:1 ratio, handheld camera, shallow 
  depth of field, ending with his face visible holding water bottle"
}
```

**Notice**: Only changed "checking" → "finding water bottle" and "worried" → "relieved"

### The 85/15 Rule for Continuations

**Keep 85% Identical Between Scenes:**
- Same character description (exact wording)
- Same environment details
- Same lighting setup and mood
- Same camera angle and framing

**Change Only 15%:**
- The specific action/movement
- Minor prop additions (if needed)
- Slight camera movement (if necessary)
- Facial expression changes

---

## 👤 CHARACTER CONSISTENCY METHODS

### Method 1: Master Character Template (Copy Exactly)

**Create Once, Use Forever:**
```
MALE PROTAGONIST TEMPLATE:
- Male, mid-30s
- Shoulder-length brown hair with natural highlights and flyaways
- Full beard (not just stubble) with slight gray patches
- Lean athletic build, 5'11"
- Weathered/rugged appearance with visible pores
- Olive green tactical jacket with chest pockets showing wear
- Dark tactical pants with cargo pockets
- Black boots with scuff marks
- Survival gear (weathered backpack, carabiner with scratches)
- Natural asymmetry in facial features
- Slight scar above right eyebrow
```

**Critical**: Never deviate from core details across scenes!

### Method 2: Claude Character Split

1. Generate full scene prompt
2. Ask Claude: "Split this prompt into character description and action/environment"
3. Result: Reusable character description + variable actions
4. Use same character description for all scenes, change only actions

### Method 3: Custom AI Model Training (For 20+ Scenes)

**For Projects Requiring Perfect Consistency:**

**Step 1: Create Character Dataset**
1. Start with one high-quality character image
2. Use VEO 3 "Frames to Video" with prompt: "turns and looks around"
3. Extract 10+ screenshots using Frame Extractor
4. Save multiple angles: front, side, 3/4 view, various expressions

**Step 2: Train Custom Model (OpenArt)**
1. Upload dataset to OpenArt Characters feature
2. Name your character (e.g., "Marcus")
3. Train model (~10 minutes)
4. Generate unlimited consistent images

**Step 3: Generate Videos with Consistency**
- Use custom model images as video starting frames
- Keep character description identical across all prompts
- Structure: `[CONSISTENT CHARACTER DESC] + [NEW ACTION] + [NEW BACKGROUND]`

**Step 4: Voice Consistency (11 Labs)**
- Export audio from VEO 3 videos
- Use 11 Labs Voice Changer for consistent character voice
- Replace inconsistent VEO 3 audio with unified voice

## 🎭 PHOTOREALISTIC CHARACTER CREATION

### The Imperfection Principle ⭐ CRITICAL

**AI defaults to unrealistic perfection. True realism requires intentional imperfections.**

❌ **What AI Defaults To**: Ultra-realistic texture overload, perfect skin, flawless hair  
✅ **What Looks Real**: Scars, pores, stray hairs, uneven skin tone, natural asymmetry

### Essential Character Detail Structure

**Use This Framework:**
```
Character Basics:
- Age, gender, ethnicity
- Facial structure (cheekbones, jawline, chin shape)
- Body type and height

Skin Imperfections (CRITICAL):
- visible pores across nose and forehead
- natural oil sheen in T-zone
- slight uneven skin tone with color variation
- fine lines around eyes deepening with expression
- natural blemishes, freckles, or marks
- subsurface scattering in backlit conditions

Eye Details (Where Humans Look First):
- Specific color with subtle tints
- Natural catchlight positioning
- Subtle red veins in whites of eyes
- Crow's feet when smiling
- Natural eyelid asymmetry
- Under-eye texture and slight darkness

Mouth & Lips (Dialogue Authenticity):
- Natural lip texture with slight dryness
- Asymmetry in smile
- Natural wrinkles around mouth
- Visible tooth imperfections if smiling

Hair (The Detail Differentiator):
- Specific color and highlights
- Thin/thick quality
- Stray strands catching light
- Natural flyaways even in styled look
- Messy sections near roots
- Individual strand visibility

Defining Human Traits:
- Unique characteristics that make them memorable
- Natural asymmetry throughout face
- Expressive features in motion
- Authentic emotional states

Clothing & Texture:
- Specific fabric types
- Visible wear patterns
- Natural wrinkles and creases
- Texture detail (pilling, weave pattern)
```

## 📸 CAMERA ANGLES = EMOTIONAL STORYTELLING

### Angles Convey Meaning

**Low Angles (Camera Looking Up)**
- **Suggests**: Power, dominance, importance, heroism
- **Use For**: Hero shots, authority figures, moments of triumph
- **Example**: `Low angle shot looking up at subject, conveying strength and dominance`

**High Angles (Camera Looking Down)**
- **Suggests**: Vulnerability, weakness, insignificance, isolation
- **Use For**: Defeated moments, showing scale, emphasizing smallness
- **Example**: `High angle looking down from above, emphasizing vulnerability and scale`

**Eye-Level Angles**
- **Suggests**: Equality, neutrality, documentary realism, connection
- **Use For**: Conversations, relatable moments, natural documentary scenes
- **Example**: `Eye-level shot creating intimate equal connection with subject`

**Dutch Angles (Tilted)**
- **Suggests**: Unease, chaos, disorientation, psychological distress
- **Use For**: Tension, horror, action sequences, unstable situations
- **Example**: `Dutch angle with 15-degree tilt creating visual tension and unease`

### Compositional Techniques

**Rule of Thirds**
```
Subject positioned on right third intersection point, balanced composition 
with environmental context on left, following professional framing standards
```

**Centered Symmetry (Wes Anderson Style)**
```
Perfect center framing with symmetrical elements flanking both sides, 
Wes Anderson-style meticulous composition, balanced and deliberate
```

**Leading Lines**
```
Leading lines from road converging toward subject in distance, natural 
path drawing viewer's eye to focal point, creating depth through perspective
```

**Foreground-Midground-Background Layering**
```
Foreground elements frame subject in midground, background provides context 
and depth, creating three-dimensional space and professional depth of field
```

## 🎨 ADVANCED LIGHTING TECHNIQUES

### Lighting = 50% of Cinematic Quality

**Lighting Specification Structure:**
```
[Natural/Artificial] + [Quality: hard/soft] + [Direction] + 
[Exposure Ratio] + [Motivation] + [Atmospheric Effects]
```

### Exposure Ratios for Cinematic Look

- **2:1** - Soft contrast, professional commercial look (RECOMMENDED)
- **4:1** - Dramatic but controlled, film noir style
- **8:1** - High drama, deep shadows, horror/thriller
- **16:1** - Extreme contrast, silhouette emphasis
- **32:1** - Maximum drama, harsh shadows (use sparingly)

**Example:**
```
Soft natural lighting from large window left at 45-degree angle, creating 2:1 
exposure ratio with gentle fill from white bounce card right, golden hour sun 
creating warm quality, volumetric dust particles visible in light beams, 
atmospheric haze adding depth
```

### Lighting Scenarios

**Golden Hour Outdoor:**
```
Natural golden hour backlight creating 4:1 dramatic ratio, long directional 
shadows stretching across ground, warm amber edge lighting on subject creating 
rim light effect, lens flares adding cinematic quality, atmospheric haze 
catching light creating volumetric god rays
```

**Moody Interior:**
```
Single dramatic spotlight from upper right creating 8:1 high-contrast ratio, 
deep shadows emphasizing drama, motivated by practical desk lamp visible in 
scene, cool blue ambient fill from window providing dimension, dust particles 
suspended in light beam
```

**Studio Product:**
```
Controlled softbox lighting from left creating 2:1 professional ratio, white 
bounce card right providing soft fill, overhead rim light creating edge 
definition, pure white seamless background with subtle gradient, clean 
commercial aesthetic
```

**Night Scene:**
```
Cool blue moonlight from above creating 4:1 ratio, warm practical lights 
(street lamps, neon signs) providing accent colors, deep shadows establishing 
night mood, slight lens flares from point light sources, atmospheric mist 
catching light
```

### Atmospheric Elements

**Light Interaction Physics:**
```
dust particles suspended in air catching light beams creating volumetric 
effects, atmospheric haze adding depth and scale, god rays streaming through 
windows creating dramatic shafts of light, subtle lens diffusion from airborne 
particles, heat wave distortion in outdoor summer scenes
```

## 🎵 AUDIO AS EQUAL PARTNER

### Audio Specification Framework

**Complete Audio Design:**
```
Audio Timeline:
- 0-2s: Ambient environmental sounds (specify location-appropriate sounds)
- 2-3s: Primary SFX moment 1 (specific sound with character)
- 3-6s: Transition sounds + music build
- 6-8s: Climax audio + final impact sound

Music Style: [specific genre] with [emotional arc]
SFX: [list each sound with timing and quality]
Ambient: [environmental layer throughout]
Dialogue: [exact words with accent/tone] (if applicable)
Technical: [ASMR detail, binaural, dBFS levels] (if applicable)

(no subtitles)
```

### ASMR Audio Blueprint

**Micro-Level Sound Design:**
```
ASMR audio detail: crisp micro-phonic 'plink' as water drop lands (0-1s), 
sustained delicate 'sizzle' and 'hiss' as gas releases (1-4s), gentle 'pop' 
sounds as bubbles burst (4-6s), soft settling 'crackle' as grounds redistribute 
(6-8s), all recorded with binaural head at -12 dBFS peaks for tactile realism
```

### Audio Categories by Scene Type

**Product Reveal:**
```
Audio: soft ambient studio hum (throughout), gentle whooshing as elements 
assemble (2-5s), satisfying 'click' and 'snap' sounds as pieces lock together 
(precise timing), rising cinematic string swell building to climax (starts 3s), 
final punctuation chord at product completion (7s), no dialogue, no subtitles
```

**Character Dialogue:**
```
Audio: natural environmental ambience (cafe background chatter, distant dishes), 
character speaks with [accent/tone]: "exact dialogue here" at 2-4s mark, 
natural vocal delivery with authentic emotion, slight reverb matching space, 
background music: soft acoustic guitar at low volume, no subtitles
```

**Action Scene:**
```
Audio: distant ambient city sounds, sudden impact sound effects synchronized 
with visual impacts (specify each moment), rising tension music with percussion 
emphasis, realistic physics sounds (clothing rustle, footsteps, breathing), 
climax hit at 6s, no dialogue, no subtitles
```

**Nature/Documentary:**
```
Audio: authentic environmental ambience (specify exact sounds: wind, birds, 
water), gentle rustling and natural sounds synchronized with movements, 
minimal to no music allowing environment to speak, soft narration if needed 
with documentary-style delivery, crisp naturalistic sound design
```

## 🎨 COLOR PALETTE MASTERY

### The 60-30-10 Rule (Professional Color Distribution)

**Formula:**
- **60%**: Dominant color (background, main environment)
- **30%**: Secondary color (supporting elements, lighting accents)

- [ ] Momentum and inertia in movements
- [ ] Material weight affecting drape and movement
- [ ] Realistic collision and impact behaviors
- [ ] Natural deterioration and wear patterns
- [ ] Environmental effects (wind, water, temperature)
- [ ] Light interaction with materials (absorption, reflection, refraction)

## 🎬 PROVEN WORKING EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Product Transformation (Coffee Bloom)

**Paragraph Format:**
```
A hyper-realistic, high-resolution, slow-motion macro video that focuses on 
the intricate details of a coffee bloom. The camera is static, providing an 
extreme close-up view captured with 100mm macro lens at F2.8. The main subject 
is a single perfect drop of water falling onto a mound of freshly ground coffee 
showing rich range of brown colors with individual granule texture visible. 
The water drop is pristine and glistening. The entire scene is bathed in a 
single dramatic spotlight creating 8:1 exposure ratio with deep shadows and 
intense highlights, giving the coffee a warm cinematic glow with gold and 
amber tones. Background is minimalist out-of-focus blur of deep blacks and 
grays. Captured in super slow motion, the video shows the single water drop 
landing on coffee grounds. Instead of splashing, drop deforms and is absorbed 
following realistic physics. This triggers spectacular "bloom" effect as coffee 
rapidly releases trapped carbon dioxide gas showing actual coffee chemistry. 
Tiny bubbles form, swell, and burst following natural physics, pushing 
surrounding grounds outward in mesmerizing fractal-like pattern. As water is 
absorbed, coffee grounds instantly darken in wave spreading from impact point. 
Color palette: 60% rich coffee browns, 30% deep shadow blacks, 10% golden 
highlight accents. Audio: incredibly crisp micro-phonic 'plink' as drop hits, 
sustained 'sizzle' and 'hiss' as gas releases, gentle 'pop' as bubbles burst, 
ASMR-like detail, binaural recording quality, no music, no subtitles. Scene 
evokes intimate scientific observation with sensory satisfaction.

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR MAXIMUM RESULTS

### 1. The Completeness Principle ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
**Professional prompts = Complete specifications, not complex descriptions**

Don't leave anything to chance:
- ✅ Every material specified with authentic imperfections
- ✅ Every light source motivated with specific ratios
- ✅ Every action following realistic physics
- ✅ Every audio element timed and characterized
- ✅ Every camera decision serving story purpose
- ✅ Every color intentionally chosen

**If results are mediocre, it's the prompt - not VEO 3.**

### 2. Think Like a Film Director
You're not describing a video - you're **designing a complete cinematic experience**:
- Camera choice and movement serve emotional purpose
- Lighting creates mood and directs attention
- Audio completes immersion and reality
- Every element has intention and motivation
- Physics and material behavior must be authentic

### 3. Use the Two-Step AI Method for Complex Scenes

**For difficult prompts:**
1. Ask Claude: "Write a detailed cinematic description of [your idea] with specific camera work, lighting ratios, audio design, and material physics"
2. Use that AI-generated description as your VEO 3 prompt

This leverages AI's ability to expand concepts into production-ready specifications.

### 4. Leverage the 85/15 Rule for Continuations
When creating multi-scene videos:
- Keep 85% identical (character, environment, lighting, camera)
- Change only 15% (action, expression, minor props)
- Always extract and use previous ending frame
- Maintain exact character description wording

### 5. Test Fast, Finalize with Quality

**Efficient Workflow:**
1. Generate test with veo3_fast ($0.38) to verify concept
2. Iterate prompt based on test results
3. Generate final version with veo3 ($1.50) once prompt is perfect
4. Always upscale final output to 4K

### 6. Audio is Not Optional
Every successful VEO 3 video includes audio specification:
- Music style with emotional arc
- SFX with precise timing
- Ambient environmental layer
- Dialogue with vocal character (if applicable)
- ASMR detail for intimate scenes

**Remember**: Audio creates 50% of immersion.

### 7. Study Professional Commercials
**Learn from pros:**
- Watch Apple product launches for minimalist tech aesthetic
- Study Nike commercials for kinetic energy and motion
- Analyze A24 films for indie cinematic mood
- Note BBC nature docs for environmental realism
- Observe how real production uses camera, lighting, sound

### 8. Build Your Prompt Library
**Create reusable templates:**
- Product reveal base template
- Character introduction template
- Brand commercial template
- Action sequence template
- Nature/environmental template

Save successful prompts and modify for future projects.

### 9. Plan for Post-Production
**Professional workflow includes:**
- Upscaling to 4K (non-negotiable)
- Color grading for consistency
- Audio replacement if needed (11 Labs)
- Film grain addition (disguises AI origin)
- Chromatic aberration (lens realism)
- Product compositing if necessary

### 10. Platform Optimization
**Different platforms need different approaches:**

**Instagram/TikTok:**
- Create vertically-framed content in 16:9, crop to 9:16
- Hook in first 2 seconds
- High energy, dynamic movement
- Mobile-optimized composition

**YouTube:**
- Horizontal 16:9 optimal
- Slower pacing acceptable
- More narrative depth
- Professional polish expected

**Ads/Commercial:**
- Brand consistency critical
- Clear product visibility
- Strong emotional hook
- Specific runtime requirements
