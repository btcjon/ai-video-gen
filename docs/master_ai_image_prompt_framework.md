# Master AI Image Prompt Framework
*The Complete System for Professional AI Image Generation*

## üéØ The Complete Prompt Formula

```
[REALISM ANCHOR] + [SUBJECT WITH IMPERFECTIONS] + [TECHNICAL CAMERA SPECS] + 
[LIGHTING WITH RATIOS] + [COMPOSITION] + [ATMOSPHERIC ELEMENTS] + 
[STYLE/AESTHETIC] + [COLOR PALETTE] + [EMOTIONAL DIRECTION] + [NEGATIVE INSTRUCTIONS]
```

## üîë CRITICAL MISSING ELEMENTS Most People Forget

### 1. INTENTIONAL IMPERFECTIONS (Essential for Realism)
AI defaults to fake perfection. You MUST add imperfections:

**Skin Texture (Critical for Faces):**
- `visible pores, natural skin texture`
- `subtle oil sheen on T-zone`
- `fine lines around eyes`
- `uneven skin tone`
- `natural blemishes, freckles`

**Hair (The Detail Differentiator):**
- `stray hair strands even in styled look`
- `natural flyaways catching light`
- `individual hair strands visible`
- `slightly messy, not perfect`

**Eyes (Where Humans Look First):**
- `subtle red veins in whites of eyes`
- `natural catchlight in pupils`
- `crow's feet when smiling`
- `asymmetrical eyelid positions`

**Example:**
```
Woman with visible pores, natural skin texture with subtle oil on forehead, 
stray hair strands catching light, crow's feet when smiling, natural 
asymmetry in features, photographed with Canon EOS R5
```

### 2. LIGHTING EXPOSURE RATIOS (Professional Photography)
Don't just say "good lighting" - specify the ratio:

- **2:1 ratio** - Soft professional look (MOST RECOMMENDED)
- **4:1 ratio** - Dramatic but controlled
- **8:1 ratio** - High drama, deep shadows
- **1:1 ratio** - Flat (avoid unless specific reason)

**Example:**
```
Soft natural lighting from window left, creating 2:1 exposure ratio with 
gentle shadows, motivated by golden hour sun
```

### 3. ATMOSPHERIC ELEMENTS (Depth and Realism)
Add light interaction physics:

- `dust particles in light beams`
- `atmospheric haze or morning mist`
- `volumetric god rays through windows`
- `heat wave distortion (outdoor scenes)`
- `light diffusion through fabric`

**Example:**
```
Interior scene with dust particles catching afternoon sunlight streaming 
through sheer curtains, volumetric light rays creating depth
```

### 4. APERTURE & DEPTH OF FIELD
Specify exact camera behavior:

- **F1.4** - Maximum bokeh, extreme blur
- **F2.8-F4** - Balanced cinematic look (RECOMMENDED)
- **F8-F11** - Sharp environmental detail  
- **F16-F22** - Everything in focus (landscapes)

**Example:**
```
Shot with 85mm lens at F2.8 aperture, shallow depth of field with subject 
in sharp focus, background softly blurred
```

### 5. COLOR PALETTE (60-30-10 Rule)
Professional color distribution:

```
Color palette: 60% muted blue-gray tones (background), 30% warm amber 
lighting (supporting), 10% vibrant red accent (subject's jacket)
```

### 6. CAMERA ANGLE = EMOTIONAL MEANING
Every angle tells a story:

- **Low angle (looking up)** - Power, dominance, importance
- **High angle (looking down)** - Vulnerability, smallness
- **Eye-level** - Equality, connection, documentary realism
- **Dutch angle (tilted)** - Unease, tension, chaos

### 7. LENS CHARACTER
Different lenses = different aesthetics:

- `Vintage Helios lens character with swirly bokeh`
- `85mm telephoto compression`
- `Anamorphic lens flares and oval bokeh`
- `iPhone 15 Pro Max handheld footage aesthetic`

### Hidden Conceptual Triggers

**Reality-Breaking Concepts:**
```
image recovered from corrupted SD card - digital decay + mystery

flashbulb memory, inaccurate recollection - distorted realism
scene from a banned children's cartoon - whimsical + unsettling
from a VHS tape never released to public - forbidden nostalgia
concept art created during a lucid dream - hyper-creativity
```

**Temporal References:**
```
as seen in National Geographic, 1993 - aged photojournalism
Photographed for an IKEA catalog, 2002 - clean furniture realism
Scanned from an artbook published in Tokyo - sharp Japanese illustration
Featured in Architectural Digest - high-end interior realism
Luxury product shot for GQ Magazine - crisp fashion-forward lighting
```

### AI Model-Specific Glitches & Oddities

```
imageboard scan, 2006 - early internet anime/manga style
DeviantArt fan concept, 2010 - fandom creativity with nostalgia
Dreamcast box art, 1999 - surreal lo-fi video game aesthetics
forgotten VHS cover art - 80s/90s with analog artifacts

## üí° PRO TIPS FOR MAXIMUM RESULTS

### 1. The Imperfection Principle ‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT
**Reality = Intentional flaws.** AI defaults to fake perfection. Always add:
- Visible pores and natural skin texture
- Stray hair strands and flyaways
- Natural asymmetry in faces
- Material wear patterns (scratches, fingerprints)
- Environmental dust particles
- Color variation and imperfect surfaces

**Remember:** *"We don't want it perfect. We want it real."*

### 2. Front-Load Critical Details
Put most important elements at the start of prompt. AI weighs early words more heavily.

**Example Order:**
1. File format/realism anchor
2. Primary subject with key details
3. Camera and lens specs
4. Lighting with ratios
5. Supporting details
6. Style and context
7. Negative instructions

### 3. Use Two-Step Method for Complex Scenes
**For difficult prompts:**
1. Ask Claude: "Write a detailed visual description of [your idea] with specific details about materials, lighting, composition, and imperfections"
2. Use that AI-generated description as your image prompt

This leverages AI's ability to expand concepts into production-ready descriptions.

### 4. Leverage Professional Terminology
**Instead of casual language, use technical terms:**
- ‚ùå "Nice lighting" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "2:1 exposure ratio with soft key light from 45 degrees"
- ‚ùå "Blurry background" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Shallow depth of field at F2.8 with bokeh"
- ‚ùå "Close-up photo" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "85mm macro lens with subject filling frame"
- ‚ùå "Good colors" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "60% earth tones, 30% cool grays, 10% warm accent highlights"

### 5. Be Specific About Materials
**Material specificity = better results:**
- ‚ùå "Glass bottle" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Frosted glass bottle with condensation droplets and label showing slight wrinkle from moisture"
- ‚ùå "Metal watch" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Brushed stainless steel with directional grain, micro-scratches catching light"
- ‚ùå "Fabric" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Cotton jersey with slight pilling, visible weave pattern, natural wrinkles"

### 6. Test and Iterate
**Professional workflow:**
1. Start with core prompt (subject + camera + lighting)
2. Generate initial image
3. Identify what needs improvement
4. Add specific modifications (more texture, different angle, etc.)
5. Regenerate with refinements
6. Repeat until perfect

### 7. Think Like a Photographer/Director
You're not just describing an image - you're **designing a complete visual experience** with:
- Camera choice and settings
- Lighting motivation and ratios
- Subject positioning and emotion
- Environmental context
- Material authenticity
- Viewer perspective

### 8. Use Reference Images When Available
If your AI tool supports it:
- Upload reference image for style matching
- Use for character consistency across multiple images
- Maintain brand aesthetic across campaign
- Ensure product accuracy

### 9. Study Professional Photography
**Learn from pros:**
- Analyze product photography on Apple.com or Nike.com
- Study portrait lighting in fashion magazines
- Notice imperfections in editorial photography
- Understand how real cameras behave

### 10. Create Prompt Templates
**Build reusable templates for common needs:**
- Product photography base template
- Portrait photography template
- UI mockup template
- Scene/environmental template

Save successful prompts and modify for future projects.

## üé¨ FINAL INSIGHT

**The difference between amateur and professional AI image generation is COMPLETENESS, not complexity.**

Professional prompts don't leave anything to chance:
- ‚úÖ Every material specified with authentic imperfections
- ‚úÖ Every light source motivated with specific ratios
- ‚úÖ Every surface showing realistic texture and wear
- ‚úÖ Every technical spec matching real camera behavior
- ‚úÖ Every color intentionally chosen using palette rules
- ‚úÖ Every emotion and angle serving a purpose

**If you're getting mediocre results, it's your prompt - not the AI.**

The AI is capable of photorealistic, professional-grade output. Your job is to communicate exactly what you want using the complete framework above.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

**For your next image generation:**

1. **Choose your domain template** (product, portrait, UI, etc.)
2. **Add realism anchor** (file format or source context)
3. **Specify imperfections** (the most critical step!)
4. **Define technical specs** (camera, lens, aperture, lighting ratio)
5. **Include atmospheric elements** (dust, haze, light interaction)
6. **Set color palette** (60-30-10 rule)
7. **Add negative instructions** (what to avoid)
8. **Generate and iterate**
